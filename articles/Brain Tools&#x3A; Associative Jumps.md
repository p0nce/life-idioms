# Brain tools: Associative Jump

In order to process trauma, explain aesthetics, and understand various other brain phenomenons, I think it is helpful to reify a basic brain operation that we could call **Associative Jumps**.

**tl;dr** Mental objects are linked in a web.


## Example 1

_Albert was evaluating a particular audio effect (tape machine emulation), when he is assaulted by overwhelming sad feelings that prevent him to continue his evaluation._

_Question: What could be a rational explanation for this?_

1. "I'm hearing a tape machine."
2. **JUMP** "This makes me think about childhood, an era where this sound was everywhere.".
3. **JUMP** "I've thought about my past and feel an intense nostalgia."



## Example 2

_Heavily intoxicated, Albert founds out that hearing pitched noise create a heavy release of neurotransmitters. Frequency 487 Hz seem to generate oxytocin, while 2.2 KHz generates something that looks like acetylcholine. Another one is all about serotonine. Albert is impressed, goes on and concludes that chakras exist and that you can equalize them with sound! But this doesn't seem to work when Albert's attention is taken._


_Question: What could be a rational explanation for this?_

**Actually** this can be explained partly by placebo, but also by an increase in the associative engine in the brain due to the intoxication.

1. "I'm hearing this frequency."
2. **JUMP** "This organ should be vibrating, if there is such a frequency to be heard".
3. **JUMP** "That organ that is near and is endocrinal is stimulated. Its output increase."

This all happens quickly enough to feel instant.


_Question: How to validate this explanation?_

Stepping into the chain and seeing if the associative chain still holds.
In this case, you could do without the noise, just thinking about the body part.



## How to find the jump?

In sober state, finding the associative jump can take more effort, especially since multiple of them are valid destinations. [Open Monitoring](#Brain-Tools:-Focused-attention-vs-Open-Monitoring) may help here, by revealing the most obvious contributors.

It seems to be that most useful jumps are also the easiest to find. **There is something that I don't understand though, it is that Associative Jumps do not seem to be as repeatable as expected.**
