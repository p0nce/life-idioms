# Thoughts should pay for themselves

1. In an ideal world, all software in existence would have positive [ATM](#Attention-Time-Money-(ATM)).

2. Contrarily Software with negative ATM is _debt_ and wouldn't exist in that ideal world. Consequently, software debt doesn't _deserve to exist_ (in the same way that there are no stocks with negative values).

3. If it were found that organized thoughts (and books) follow a similar ATM economics as software, then they also wouldn't deserve to exist.

4. The very act of forming and maintaining _mental debt_ (instead of _mental assets_) would be a net loss to the individual ; in the same way that negative ATM software is a net loss to society in general.

5. In other words: not all books deserve to be written, and not all thoughts deserve to be formed. And there will be interests to pay on them too: bad books being read, or bad thoughts being maintained.

Like software artifacts, thoughts should pay for themselves.
