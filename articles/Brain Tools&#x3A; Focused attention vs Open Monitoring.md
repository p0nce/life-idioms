# Brain Tools: Focused Attention vs Open Monitoring


There seems to be 3 big types of meditation, two of which have been categorized as ["Focused Attention" and "Open Monitoring"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2010.01.007) (Travis & Shear, 2010).

You can get a feel for those results:

- You could meditate with focused attention and reach [Alpha State](https://www.wikihow.com/Enter-Alpha-State-of-Mind), which takes some training.

- You could meditate with open monitoring and without particular training, get troubling thoughts out of the way _(which is super useful for stress)_.

In this article, with the example of hearing, I claim that there is likewise **two ways of listening,** completely parallel to those two meditation types.


## Case 1: Focused Attention listening

In focused attention, you concentrate on an individual feature, possibly loosing the forest for the trees. Everything else that might tend to attract attention is actively ignored by redirecting attention constantly back on the same focus point.

_Example: "Which sound has the best low-end?"?_


## Case 2: Open Monitoring listening

In Open Monitoring listening, **you would try to think about nothing** and examinate the first thing that comes to your mind.

_Example: "Which sound would you rather hear in your car?"_


## A more general claim

I claim that there is always those two ways of considering a perception (possibly: any mental object?).

Reifying Open Monitoring is super useful indeed, since **by being open to ideas that come up, you can more easily perform [Associative Jumps](#Brain-Tools:-Associative-Jumps), or find a start point to your associative search.**


Open Monitoring is called ["Deconcentration of Attention"](http://deconcentration-of-attention.com/) in the Russian litterature.
