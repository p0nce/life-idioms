# I'm a former sufferer of DPDR 

Few people know this about me, but I've been technically "mad" with the trouble known as Depersonalization / Derealization Disorder (DPDR) and got out of it.


## My story with DPDR

I've had 3 episodes of DPDR, starting at age 19:
- 2007: a severe 2 month episode, drug-induced comorbid with HPPD, BDD, tinnitus, and a small depression.
  I knew nothing about the trouble, and thought it was a unique situation. I told no one and only heared about "DPDR" 3 years later.
- 2011 to 2012: a one year burnout cycle that ended up in DPDR, comorbid with emotional depletion, and suicidal thoughts for the last month.
- 2019: a one hour relapse, short but scary enough. I just read the wrong book by Sartre!

I'm very lucky to be cured thanks to [trauma processing](Processing-Traumas).


## What is DPDR?

[Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder) is little-known dissociative disorder with a prevalence of 1 to 2%, often undiagnosed and underresearched. It is essentially a defense mechanism against stress, that is itself pretty fucked up. It goes by several names: DPDR, DDD, DDS, DPD.
