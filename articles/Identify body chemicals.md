# Identify body chemicals

**DICLAIMER: I'm not a physiologist, and do not work in medicine. Do not start new addictions. I'm just dabbling. The reality is probably more complex.**

In research of diagonalization, I feel that it can be helpful to identify body compounds by their imprint, in order to try to "invert" their effects on judgement.

Often the idea is to eat chemical precursors to increase the quantity effect of the compound. 


## Sugar

A good way to develop a sense for effects of sugar is biking. Because this sport puts you closer to being an energy tank.


## Serotonin

Using THC 1 hour after eating _chick peas_ will produce a high that has a serotonin color. You might even feel a buzz from chick peas alone after one hour.

Fasting also increase serotonine.


## Dopamine

Using THC 1 hour after eating _red beans_ will produce a high that has a serotonin color. 
Beware: this is more anxiety-inducing than just THC.

This seems to increase placebo effects, or to be the root cause of it.


## Anandamide

The so-called runner's high is partly anandamide.

2 hours before running, drink a combination of: paracetamol, powder chocolate and grapeseed oil. It has an awful taste.


## BNDF

The other component of the runner's high (BNDF) seems to require fasting and slow running a long-time.


## Testosterone

Sensed the most the day after sport, especially if high intensity was involved.


## Inflammation (not a compound)

General quantity of inflammation can be lowered with Chinese cabbage (for example eating half of it).

Instead, it can be increased with carbs, such as bread/pasta, which feels much worse.


## Do you know any others?

I'd like to hear ways to distinguish norepinefrine, GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine...
It is also possible I'm mistaking one chemicals for another.
