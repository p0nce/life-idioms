# Processing Traumas


## Why process traumas?

I was super anxious for the first 25 years of my life. 

After two episodes of [DPDR](What-DPDR-feels-like), I finally became interested in lowering those stress levels for good.
Despire its strangeness, DPDR is hopelessly mechanical: it goes away if and only if the stress goes down.

What is the main contributor to chronic, high-stress levels? [Unprocessed traumatic memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_memories). 

I'm convinced **everyone has a backlog of unprocessed traumas** and could benefit from (preferably assisted) trauma processing.

It's generally the things you normally _avoid_ thinking about.


## A time for everything

Not thinking about complicated memories is reasonable when the timing isn't right.

Activating the traumatic memory will create stress of its own. 
**It's better to process traumas from a comfortable position.**

It's important to be easy on oneself and comfortable.


## A mental model for traumas

A trauma _splits_ life's narrative into _before_ and _after_, with seemingly no link between the former and latter states.

In computer terms, a trauma is a bit like a new git branch, and solving the traumas is akin to a git merge. With big splits, you might even meet the "trauma-holder", a remain of personnality that embodies life as it was at the moment of the trauma.


## A quick method for solving traumas

Finding the stress source is usually **associative**, solving the issue is usually **transactional**.

_This is a work in progress._
