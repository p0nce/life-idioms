# Futuristic ideas not being pursued

These days it's all about AI, and Web3, and crypto, and other things I can only classify as distractions. This is the neverending noise of our times.

I'm afraid that **real progress may not look anything like that.** It may well hide in the little things. Actually my belief is that we could live in a futuristic world if only we paid attention.

Here is what I think humanity should do.

## Apply meta-reseach

Use [meta-research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metascience) systematically to detect promising, formerly ignored papers and techniques. 

Meta-reseachers have now produced lots of recommendations that we just need to apply to discover more things, quicker. That is, if you want to continue scientific research.

The police has its FBI, and it is located above in the hierarchy. Why shouldn't Research have a feedback loop too?


## Asking animals for help

The fast development of [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) and animal studies could perhaps enable us to not only communicate with other species, but also ask them for help in light of the ecological catastrophy.

If we can convince trees, or their fungus complexes, to pump more CO2 from the air, why not try?


## Viewing IP through a Marxist lens

In this hidden blog, I have laid the foundation of explaining software through a self-discovered tautological [theory of software](#Attention-Time-Money-(ATM)). It also applies to Intellectual Property in general (including remixes) and thought systems. Though not terribly useful, I think we could bridge economy and software development in a unified framework. Because I suspect there is nothing mysterious about software, just white collar conceptual goo.


## Democratize change of mind

[Trauma processing](#DIY-Processing-Traumas) could perhaps be routine instead of a mysterious practice. Besides relief, one side-product of trauma relief is: the training of our capacity to "change our mind", probably through some kind of neural weights remapping.

This capacity need not be linked to traumas at all; it is separate. We could use more of that to change our mind when needed. I believe anyone can be trained to do it.

This has huge implications for quality of life, and self-determination. Once void of parasite thought, humans can feel "neutral" and suitably empty, ready for proper judgement.


## Solving narcissism

I'm now pretty sure the right mental manipulation can solve the narcissist personnality disorder. For some reason there is no will to uncover this secret.

I'm also convinced the [attachment style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory) to be changeable through a similar technique, working on primary attachment objects.

This could be a huge help in reducing harassement and the general inadequacy of narcissism, and could help people build _rapport_.

I suspect there is such a range of far-reaching, violent but impressive mental manipulations to discover.


## Voluntary personnality change

We may research more the small-time [Volitional personnality changes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128046746000338) and find the factors that can lead someone to become more or less extraverted for example, more or less open to experience, etc.


## Allergies, sleep apnea, and autoimmune disease with CBT-like methods

We need to investigate the link between brain and immune system. [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBT)-like methods can probably help with a wide variety of troubles that were thought out of scope. When it doesn't help, it seems that at least the problem gets less noticeable.

If people are teaching "Body Reprogramming" for fibromyalgia, maybe we could make people move their teeth for sleep apnea instead of waking up.


## Deconstructing status

If one could synthesize "status", there would be less of need to spend its life pursuing status at the expense of others.

Through virtual reality, people could experience low or high status at will, leading to "status awareness".
