# No one will tell you this business advice

Making a software business does teach [a few non-obvious thing](#From-programmer-to-founder).

The best business advice for first-time founders is, in my opinion, the following:

**PICK AN EASY MARKET**

The corrolary of which is:

**DO NOT PICK A DIFFICULT MARKET**

and also:

**DO NOT PICK A NON-EXISTING MARKET**

That's it. 


## The problem with hero√Øcs ideals

Having to do heroic efforts is indicative of a market that doesn't make lots of money for lots of people. Say, video games if you are the average independent game developer.

Picking a difficult market can symbolically often be a _bourgeois_ decision to keep a high-status and avoid really meddling with lower-class people. As a way to avoid competent competition. Or a way to having "boring" tasks.


## The problem with skewing higher-class


As a reader of that blog, you may probably skew on richer and higher-educated. This is also the characteristics of early adopters.

In general, most founders  and the first users they will encouter will be a higher-class than the general population. **This is catastrophically bad.**

Consequently the stereotypical start-up company will look like this:
- hiring high-class people,
- to make products that mostly appeal to high-class people, and reflect high-class values,
- and make no money in the process.

That is inevitably far from realizing the growth potential, because **you may inadvertently remove the majority of the target market** with bourgeois thinking.

When I was a lowly snob intern at a very well known audio company, its founder told me very seriously that we were here to make software for everyone, not just snobs like me. Bourgeois thinking is like a tax on society.

## Actionnable advice

Go the easiest market you can find, that verifiably make a lot of easy money for a non-trivial group of people. Make a product to get your foot in the door, and go bully the weakest competitor in the room.
