# No one will tell you this business advice

Making a software business does teach [a few non-obvious thing](#From-programmer-to-founder).

The best business advice for first-time founders is, in my opinion, the following:

**"PICK AN EASY MARKET"**

The corrolary of which is:

**"DO NOT PICK A DIFFICULT MARKET"**

and also:

**"DO NOT PICK A NON-EXISTING MARKET"**

That's it. 


## The problem with hero√Øcs ideals

Having to do heroic efforts is indicative of a market that doesn't make lots of money for lots of people. Say, video games if you are the average independent game developer.

I believe picking a difficult market can be a consequence of _bourgeois thinking._ 

By picking a difficult market (aka... prestigious) you happens is that:
- stay high-status, 
- avoid really meddling with lower-class people, 
- avoid competition, 
- avoid work qualified as "boring"(we all know we mean "low-status" with that)

All of which are really non-goals for a business.


## The problem with skewing higher-class


As a reader of that blog, you may probably skew on richer and higher-educated. This is also the characteristics of **early adopters** (cf. history of inventions).

In general, most founders  and the first users they will encouter will be a higher-class than the general population. **This is bad.**

Consequently the stereotypical start-up company will look like this:
- hiring high-class people,
- to make products that mostly appeal to high-class people, and reflect high-class values,
- and make no money in the process.

That is inevitably far from realizing the growth potential, because **you may inadvertently remove the majority of the target market** with bourgeois thinking.

When I was a lowly snob intern at a very well known audio company, its founder told me very seriously that we were here to make software for everyone, not just snobs like me. Bourgeois thinking acts like a tax on society. **This was one of the most on-point advice I ever got.**

## Actionnable advice

Go the easiest market you can find, that verifiably make a lot of easy money for a non-trivial group of people. Make a product to get your foot in the door, and go bully the weakest competitor in the room.

That is the business advice you won't hear from anyone, because everyone is shooting status-enhancing quotes from Steve Jobs.
