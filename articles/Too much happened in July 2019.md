# A lot happened in July 2019

In a surprising sequence of events, the month of mid-July to mid-August 2019 was **a lot** more eventful than usual.

- I moved and then was suspected in the murder of my former landlord.
- Had an brief affair with someone I later fell in love with.
- Had a scary one-hour relapse in DP;DR because of a book.
- I released a new plug-in Panagement 2.0.
- Moved flat.
- People helped get back into the new flat when I locked myself out, and then stole my wallet.

Being adventurous is not exactly a goal to me ; I consider it more like a defect.
So I was very thankful that such a high-intensity month did not ever repeat.
