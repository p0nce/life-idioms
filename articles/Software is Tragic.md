# On the tragicness of Software

We propose that Software as practiced in our human societies is an inherently _tragic_ activity. As shown regularly by the catastrophic failures of software projects, there is a sobering difference between our aspirations and the reality.

Indeed Software today has several observable macro-features.


## High recurring costs

_Debt_ seems to be a central theme to software development, but humans are more prone to taking on debt than being able to pay it down. What is being observed is high recurring costs, the most obvious of which is the need for growing teams of engineers for essentially sub-linear problems.


## Abandonment, being late, under-delivering

There is a tendency for software projects to run late, over-budget, under-deliver, and even create litigation. This inefficiency has been dubbed _Software crisis_ by observers.


## A "craft" activity without much craftiness

Few key lessons from the past seems to be retained in software. Software was already quite-understood in the 1960s, but the practical understanding hasn't really grown a lot, and is instead subject to unending cycles of hype. To the extent that software development in 2020 is conceptually largely identical to software development in 1980, despite changes in toolchain.

The most striking effect to this is that practionners have trouble thinking about a piece of code that would be "beautiful". The most realistic description of Software today is that of an ocean of abandoned, toxic feces.
