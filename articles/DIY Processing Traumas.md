# DIY Processing Traumas

**DICLAIMER: Do not read that article and do not Do It Yourself. This article is only my opinion.**

**Go find a licensed psychologist, that will find a respectful and manageable path towards processing traumas.**

**The mentionned techniques can be pretty confusing, harsh and generates permanent personnality changes. It is even the entire goal.
But reactivation of traumatic memories can be very harmful and in some cases cause anxiety attacks and extreme levels of stress.**

**If you have to do that, do it from a position of comfort, when you are already feeling great.**


## Why process traumas?

After two episodes of [DPDR](What-DPDR-feels-like), I forcefully became interested in lowering those stress levels for good.
Despire its strangeness, DPDR is mechanical: it goes away if the stress goes down.

It turned out the main contributor to chronic high-stress levels was [unprocessed traumatic memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_memories). A thesis also defended on [that other website](http://depersonalizationrecovery.com/).



I'm convinced **everyone has a backlog of unprocessed traumas** and could benefit from thinking about it, when the conditions feels right.


Activating the traumatic memories for examination create a stress of its own, and a chronic one, so it's better to process traumas from a comfortable position. 
Or, to process the ones that have already been reactivated in a chronic manner.

In other words: do things one by one and leave ample times before such works.

And it's also better to only treat the most recently activated source of stress.  

**Go in reverse temporality and do not start searching for traumas, start from the stress of daily life to find them.**


## Start small

Processing traumas gets easier with practice. **Start with easy ones and go slow.**

_Example 1: Adam was driving, and see a dog about to cross the road. He slows down. But the dog doesn't move at all, he just stands here just next to the road, as if about to cross. It turns out it was probably dead and another car hit it in the nose. Adam is disgusted and this particular memory comes back after the trip._

_Example 2: Bob watched a film named _The Act of Killing_. It is the most disturbing film he has ever watched. He regrets watching it and made a nightmare with a traumatic color and a film protagonist that says with a horrible voice "Are you going to kill me?"._


Sounds small potatoes, yeah? Maybe, maybe not.

In almost every case, you will be astounded by the emotional charge associated with even small events like this.
By association you _will_ stumble upon the big stuff, sooner or later, but do not rush this. 


**Be kind with yourself** and try to find inconsequential things, perhaps even non-traumatic things, to think about.


## Mental model of traumatic memories

This article proposes a method (akin to Neuro-Linguistic Programming) to self-treat lingering traumas by [reconsolidating traumatic memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_memories#Reconsolidation). The Wikipedia article is better than this article so maybe jump your reading there.

Do you really want to read a method from an armchair psychologist?



## Full recipe


### **Step 1: Start Point.**

Using [Open Monitoring](#Brain-Tools:-Focused-attention-vs-Open-Monitoring) think about the distressing recent stress, or a permanent stress you've felt.

You will get a start point to your associative journey.

_Exemple: Adam thinks about his sentiment of dread seeing the dead dog on the road._


### **Step 2: associative search.**

Perform one (or more) of the most obvious [Associative Jumps](#Brain-Tools:-Associative-Jumps).

Be honest with yourself and find the true most obvious jumps. You can end your associative search on several types of mental-object:

   - a memory
   - a belief
   - a "rite of passage" (door to be entered, cavern... "do you want to know?)


So there are 3 possible scenarios here, only one of which is adressed in this article:

  - **Case 2.1: The trauma is complex.**  
    You end up on a "core belief" or a "value", unrelated to a single memory but a myriad of non-traumatic memories.

    _Exemple: "I was raised as if I had no value."_
 
    This is best treated with actual psychotherapy such as [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy), not by treating traumas.

  - **Case 2.2: The trauma is singular.**  
    You end up on a **single memory from where most of the stress is originating.**  

    _Exemple: "They day where Adam's dog died."_

    **Wait** before you think about that particular memory. Continue avoiding it until safety is in place.  
    Go to step 3.

  - **Case 2.3: The trauma is inter-generational (advanced).**  
    After a mental "rite of passage" (that you can refuse), you end up on unspecific abstract traumas with no emotional charge, no associated memories.  

    _Exemple: "The fuzzy feeling of being beaten by someone larger."_

    Unfortunately I do not have enough experience with that to advise you. The problem is that one doesn't have any traumatic memory to work with.

### **Step 3: Reconsolidation.**


Your goal is to discharge the emotional content of the singular memory and "re-learn" it.

  Use the following two powerful safety procedures:

  - **Use the time-reverse method:** explore your memory from a few hours after to the beginning in a reverse fashion. The film is in reverse in the cinema.

  - **Use double disassociation:** method: you are watching someone in a cinema who watch the film of your memory on a screen.
  

  You should not be overwhelmed by emotions. Reliving the trauma as is (exposure) is NOT the goal.


  What you can do then:
  - **Examinate subsequent beliefs:** You may have "over-learned" something because of the trauma.
  - **Change modalities:** Change the shape, colors, scent of things in your memory to make it clear you are rewriting it. Why not make the memory ridiculous?
  - **Change point of view:** If an agression, view the scene as the aggressor, a spectator, etc.. what is a rational explanation for what happened?
  - **Just watch the reversed film:** Reintegrate it into your autobiographic memory. Because of time reversal, sometimes it's not even needed to go through the violent parts.


After you are done, the memory should be reintegrated/modified as a normal memory, without emotional charge.
  Release of tears and a sentiment of peace is a good sign.
  You can do this while staying calm, it need not be a panicky feeling.


  _One very disturbing thing at first is that **there is no actual need to be faithful about what really happened** in your new tampered memory since only the results matter._
  _The truth matters less than your well-being. If the truth mattered so much, our memory wouldn't be rewriteable. But, traumatized people are often obsessed with realistic exact history and it can feel like "cheating"._

  

### **Step 4: The case of larger traumas (optional)**


**For a large trauma** your life have been clearly split in two disjointed timelines, before and after the event.
And you don't feel the same person before and after.

It is possible that you meet a "trauma-holder", a personality fragment at the age that you were at the memory point.
If you want to solve the trauma, you will accept the trauma holder as he/she is, and somehow merge it with your current self.
If you do this, you will have a single merged life timeline again.

In computer terms, a trauma would be a bit like a new `git branch`, and solving the traumas is akin to a `git merge`. 
But the analogy stops here, because the forked branch has been left undevelopped and in disarray.



### Aftermath

Lowered stress levels seems permanent.
Solving most singular traumas shift personnality for a few weeks.
Some advanced mental manipulations like that can provoke larger swings in personnality (eg: maniac phase / depressive phase) that can oscillate for a few monthes.


## Conclusion

If you don't want to be on your own, go consult a licensed psychologist.
