# What DPDR feels like


## What is DPDR?

[Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder) is little-known dissociative disorder with a prevalence of 1 to 2%, often undiagnosed and underresearched. It is essentially a natural defense mechanism against sustained cortisol levels (stress).

It goes by several names: DPDR, DDD, DDS, DPD.

What might seems at first like a curious metaphysical experience (having no personnality), is a surprisingly painful condition.


## My story with DPDR

In my life I've had 3 episodes of DPDR:
- In Early 2007: a severe 2 month(?) episode of DPDR, drug-induced comorbid with HPPD, BDD, tinnitus, and a small depression.
- June 2011 to June 2012: a one year burnout cycle that started quite light, then became more severe, with DPDR setting in towards the end.
- One very small relapse in 2019: lasted only one hour, was scary but did return to normal with the same personnality.

I'm very lucky to be cured thanks to [trauma processing](Processing-Traumas). It could be way worse, research is pointing out that a lot of people have to endure that without being ever cured. 


## Intensity

Strong DPDR feels like a living hell and unmistakable sensation, while light DPDR will just feature a lack of emotions.


## Stress

Basically your body is permanently in survival "fight or flee" response.
You don't feel stressed anymore while suffering DPDR, however you can recognize that the cortisol is hidden by the dissociation, and the stress is still here underneath.
In this situation, you can't cure the stress problem, but you can find some coping mechanisms, such as _watching someone else story_, video games, etc.

DPDR is a reaction to shock, that itself is shocking. You are living "inside" a traumatic memory.


## "Brain fog"

Severe DPDR comes with a particular mental restlessness that can hamper the ability to sleep, think, and relax.
The sufferer might be afraid of becoming schizophrenic, for no reason at all.


## Third person

You are the Observer.
You are not living but watching someone lives that happens to be yourself.
You do not meet people but flesh actors that believes they are people.
You do not walk in nature, but in a decor in the film of your life.

Feeling like the Observer is a feeling that can be invoked independently of DPDR, once cured.
While it is quite hard to invoke in normal times. But in DPDR you are locked into this 3rd person, objective mode.


## Emotions

The sufferer is unable to have emotions like joy, love, sadness - and feels no attachment either.
Seeing a loved-one will provoke you no more emotion that if you had encountered an automaton.
Under DPDR, seeing old friends is like meeting strangers.


## Memory

Life through this traumatic period is intense, however memories are not treated the same while the DPDR is active.

While the DPDR lasts, it very much seems like _life outside dissociation_ will never come back, and was long ago. Something to be forgotten since that now, you're seemingly permanently altered (and not in a good way !). **DPDR always feels like the new normal**, however twisted it is.

Strangely enough, life under such dissociation doesn't feel less "real" than normalcy. It actually **feels more real** since the humanity layer that was interpreting raw information is gone, and you are left with what feels like a more raw, over-analytic, reptilian-era brain. 

This is why I say personality is like being in a bubble: it filters information and creates meaning when there is sometimes little.

When things go back to the normalcy you thought was impossible though, you will have trouble remembering what really happened and in what order while dissociated. It will seem very remote that you could have had no personnality for such a long period of time.


## Character creation

DPDR disappears in a pretty much mechanical way: less stress leading to less dissociation.

Emotions, feelings, and information filtering come back.
What happens next is that a new personnality appears in six month, not too far from the original.

This is **a very interesting time** when you can seemingly choose the features of your newfound bubble.



## Meaning dissolvation

It's hard to explain properly this one after so many years.

Essentially, the forces that maintain _continuity of meaning_ for things, concepts, words, and of course your personnality (which is mental object like any other...), stop their course.

You would look at an pear, see it is of a particular pear shape, pear color, and has a word for it: "pear". 
But none of these things form a cohesive whole around an actual "pear" concept you might previously have.

In a way, **the "pear" concept only has a sustained existence because we continue to nourish it**.

Like the fast movement of the eye giving the impression of a detailed, high resolution visual world ; the fast _meaning creation_ of the brain is giving the impression of whole well-separated concepts.

In a way, having a personnality is a comforting bubble that sustain that meaning creation.

The person experiencing DPDR see its personnality structure dissolved, because _every other thought concept is also dissolved_.


## Art

On the plus side.
Music, films, and museums can give a lot more impression than usual. I've had strong reactions to, all things considered, pretty average music in these times.
