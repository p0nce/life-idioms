# What DPDR feels like


_DICLAIMER: I FORMALLY DECLINE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY HARM THAT COULD HAPPEN FOLLOWING THE READ OF THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE. Close this page now. This article isn't meant for anyone to read. You don't want to know. I'm only trying to [remember](#On-being-a-former-sufferer-of-DPDR)._

_This is a dangerous article to read. And it was annoying to write. I'm really just doing it to try to connect the dots. Reading about DPDR triggers a strange meditative state for me. I'm genuinely scared to write that shit article. Only read this is you are not an anxious person. There is an interesting article [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/enlightenments-evil-twin/383726/) that is perfectly adequate to explain the most interesting points._


## TL;DR

[DPDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder) is living without a personnality, and without "storytelling". What might seems at first like a curious metaphysical experience, is also a **surprisingly painful condition**.

It comes in various intensity levels. Light DPDR features only a few symptoms, but strong DPDR is a living hell.


## Third person

You are the Observer.
You are not living but watching someone live, that happens to be you.

You do not meet people but lifeless actors that believes they are people. The fact they believe they are people is of course ridiculous, because all humans are more like cardboard automatons.

The way they communicate with you makes it very clear they don't know they are carboard automatons, and they also believe in a fuckton of grand ideas that don't actually exist.

You do not walk in nature, but in a decor in the film of your life.

The Observer is a feeling that can be invoked independently of DPDR, once cured.
It is quite hard to invoke in normal times. But in DPDR you are locked into this 3rd person mode: the most objective you have ever been. :)
Consequently, you are more likely to perform "out of character" actions that will surprise and delight your peers.


## Stress

While the disease itself is _caused_ by stress, one **do not** feel stressed anymore while suffering DPDR.
The cortisol is hidden by the dissociation. The stress feeling is still here, but underneath.

Basically your body is locked in [fight-or-flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response) response.

In this situation, you are in need of coping mechanisms, such as watching someone else's story. Because the real source of the stress might be remote and other symptoms may complicate root cause analysis.


## Emotions

The sufferer is unable to have emotions like joy, love, sadness - and feels no attachment either.
Seeing a loved-one provokes no more emotion that if you had encountered a lifeless robot.

Under DPDR, seeing old friends is like meeting strangers. Because - as we'll see later on - the concept of your friendship have disintegrated. _Like most other concepts._

I guess because in a situation of acute danger, it isn't exactly critical to feel in love or sad.


## "Brain fog"

Severe DPDR comes with a particular mental restlessness that can hamper the ability to sleep, think, and relax. Thoughts just won't stop. I think this is the worse symptom of heavy DPDR.


## Memory

While the DPDR lasts, it very much seems like _life outside dissociation_ will never come back, and was long ago. Something to be forgotten since that now, you're seemingly permanently altered (and not in a good way !). **DPDR feels like the new normal**, something final even, however twisted that is. Perhaps it was always this way?

The possibility that things may be back to normal looks very remote.

Strangely enough, life under such dissociation doesn't feel less "real" than normalcy. It actually feels _more_ real since the "humanity layer" that was interpreting raw information is gone, and you are left working with an older, raw, analytic, bare-metal brain. 

Life under DPDR is stripped of its human elements, and as such it feels obviously simpler and truer.

This is why I say personality is like being in a bubble: it filters information and creates meaning when there is sometimes little.

When things _do_ go back to the normalcy you thought was impossible, you will have trouble remembering what really happened and in what order. It will seem very remote that you could have had no personnality for such a long period of time. Your time dissociated and non-dissociated feel like disjointed segments of life.


## Meaning generation has stopped

It's hard to explain properly this one after so many years. I have difficulty remembering symptoms from 2007.

Essentially, the forces that maintain _continuity of meaning_ for things, concepts, words, and of course your personnality (which is a mental object like any other...), stop their course.

You would look at an pear, see it is of a particular pear shape, pear color, and has a word for it: "pear". 
But none of these things form a cohesive whole around an actual "pear" concept you might previously have.

In normal times, **concepts have a sustained existence because we continuously nourish them**.

Like the fast movement of the eye giving the impression of a detailed, high resolution visual world ; the fast _meaning creation_ of the brain is giving the impression of whole well-separated concepts that help understanding the world.

The person experiencing DPDR see its personnality structure dissolved, because _every other thought concept was also dissolved_. They were broke down to their constitutive components, without the story-teller that makes them united.

In a way, personnality is a comforting **bubble** that sustain that meaning creation. It insulates from tons of raw, meaningless events that do not sustain the personal narrative. The Ego has a good User Experience that simplifies life for us. As far as I'm concerned, it is definately a Good Thing.


## Art

Music, films, and museums can give a lot more impression than usual. I would typically feel way more connection to music in this state.
This is definately a positive, as you get to find profoundness in pretty average things. :)


## When DPDR disappears

DPDR disappears in a pretty much mechanical way: less stress leading to less dissociation.

Emotions, feelings, and information filtering come back. It is of course an immense relief, since you get to experience happiness again.
What happens next is that a new personnality appears in about six month, not too far from the original.

This is also **a very important and interesting time** when you can seemingly choose the features of your newfound personnality bubble.
