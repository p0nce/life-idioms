# What DPDR feels like

[DPDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder) is living without a personnality.

What might seems at first like a curious metaphysical experience, is instead a **surprisingly painful condition** that takes everything you have.

For me, light DPDR will just feature a lack of emotions. But strong DPDR most accurate definition would be "a living hell". 


## Stress

While the disease itself is caused by stress, you **don't** feel stressed anymore while suffering DPDR.
The cortisol is hidden by the dissociation. The stress is still here, underneath.

Basically your body is locked in [fight-or-flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response) response.

In this situation, you are in need of coping mechanisms, such as watching someone else's story. Because the real source of the stress might be remote and you don't have the serenity to investigate.


## Third person

You are the Observer.
You are not living but watching someone lives that happens to be yourself.
You do not meet people but flesh actors that believes they are people. The fact they believe they are people is of course beyond ridiculous, because all humans are cardboard automatons. 
You do not walk in nature, but in a decor in the film of your life.

The Observer is a feeling that can be invoked independently of DPDR, once cured.
It is quite hard to invoke in normal times. But in DPDR you are locked into this 3rd person mode: the most objective you have ever been.


## Emotions

The sufferer is unable to have emotions like joy, love, sadness - and feels no attachment either.
Seeing a loved-one will provoke you no more emotion that if you had encountered a lifeless robot.

Under DPDR, seeing old friends is like meeting strangers. Because - as we'll see later on - the concept of your friendship have disintegrated. Like most other concepts.


## "Brain fog"

Severe DPDR comes with a particular mental restlessness that can hamper the ability to sleep, think, and relax. The sufferer is typically afraid of becoming schizophrenic, for no reason at all.




## Memory

While the DPDR lasts, it very much seems like _life outside dissociation_ will never come back, and was long ago. Something to be forgotten since that now, you're seemingly permanently altered (and not in a good way !). **DPDR feels like the new normal**, something final even, however twisted that is.

The possibility that things may be back to normal look very remote.

Strangely enough, life under such dissociation doesn't feel less "real" than normalcy. It actually **feels more real** since the humanity layer that was interpreting raw information is gone, and you are left working with an older, raw, analytic, reptilian-era brain. 

Life under DPDR is stripped of its human elements, and as such it feels obviously simpler and truer.

This is why I say personality is like being in a bubble: it filters information and creates meaning when there is sometimes little.

When things go back to the normalcy you thought was impossible though, you will have trouble remembering what really happened and in what order while dissociated. It will seem very remote that you could have had no personnality for such a long period of time.


## Meaning dissolvation

It's hard to explain properly this one after so many years.

Essentially, the forces that maintain _continuity of meaning_ for things, concepts, words, and of course your personnality (which is mental object like any other...), stop their course.

You would look at an pear, see it is of a particular pear shape, pear color, and has a word for it: "pear". 
But none of these things form a cohesive whole around an actual "pear" concept you might previously have.

In a way, **the "pear" concept only has a sustained existence because we continue to nourish it**.

Like the fast movement of the eye giving the impression of a detailed, high resolution visual world ; the fast _meaning creation_ of the brain is giving the impression of whole well-separated concepts that help understanding the world.

The person experiencing DPDR see its personnality structure dissolved, because _every other thought concept was also dissolved_.

In a way, having a personnality is a **comforting bubble** that sustain that meaning creation. It has a good User Experience that simplifies life for us. And indeed, life outside the bubble is pretty much unlivable.




## Art

On the plus side.
Music, films, and museums can give a lot more impression than usual. I've had strong reactions to, all things considered, pretty average music in these times.


## When DPDR disappears

DPDR disappears in a pretty much mechanical way: less stress leading to less dissociation.

Emotions, feelings, and information filtering come back. It is an immense relief.
What happens next is that a new personnality appears in about six month, not too far from the original.

This is also **a very interesting time** when you can seemingly choose the features of your newfound personnality bubble.
