# On being a former sufferer of DPDR 

A few people IRL know this about me, but in the past I've been technically "mad" with the trouble known as Depersonalization / Derealization Disorder (DPDR). 

While many people experience symptoms of a depersonalization/derealization disorder during their life; I have a simple theory about why few people talk about it: it is difficult to explain and too shameful/asocial to tell.


## My story with DPDR

- **2007:** a severe 2 month episode, psylocibyn-induced comorbid with HPPD, BDD, tinnitus.
  I was 19 :).
- **2011 to 2012:** a one year burnout cycle that ended up in mild DPDR, comorbid with emotional depletion, and suicidal thoughts for the last month. It felt like forever.
- **2019:** a one hour relapse, short but scary enough. 
  I would read La Naus√©e by Sartre and it turns out the book can effectively trigger the disease temporarily for me, thanks to its play on words.

I consider myself cured from 2012 to 2014 thanks to DIY [trauma processing](Processing-Traumas), a great method for a whole lot of troubles.


## Why talk about it at all?

It feels sane, and culturally possible in 2021, to be in a position to admit to those weaknesses.

In the software industry you cannot really speak about things like burnout or mental illness without harming your economic prospects.
Thankfull I become economically independent from the technical Guernica known as the Software Industry, and can talk about real-life problems freely.

Those troubled periods had a disproportionate impact on my life. One of the intent of this blog it to get over them; while statisfying your voyeurism edge.


## What is DPDR?

[Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder) is little-known dissociative disorder with a prevalence of 1 to 2%, often undiagnosed and underresearched. It is essentially a defense mechanism against stress, that gets somehow stuck. It goes by several names: DPDR, DDD, DDS, DPD...

DPDR is strongly associated with [childhood interpersonal trauma](https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.158.7.1027).
