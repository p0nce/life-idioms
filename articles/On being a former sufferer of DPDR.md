# On being a former sufferer of DPDR 

A few people IRL know this about me, but in the past I've been technically "mad" with the trouble known as Depersonalization / Derealization Disorder (DPDR). 

While many people experience symptoms of a depersonalization/derealization disorder during their life; I have a simple theory about why few people talk about it: it is shameful and not exactly status-enhancing.


## My story with DPDR

- **2007:** a severe 2 month episode, drug-induced comorbid with HPPD, BDD, tinnitus.
  I was 19 :).
- **2011 to 2012:** a one year burnout cycle that ended up in DPDR, comorbid with emotional depletion, and suicidal thoughts for the last month.
- **2019:** a one hour relapse, short but scary enough. 
  I would read La Naus√©e by Sartre and the book can effectively trigger the disease temporarily for me, thanks to its play on words.

I cured myself from 2012 to 2014 thanks to [trauma processing](Processing-Traumas), a great method for a whole lot of troubles.


## Why so whiney?

I understand that it all sounds a bit whiney, but rest assured I'm not a weak person. It feels great, and culturally possible in 2021, to be in a position to admit to those weaknesses.

In the software industry you cannot really speak about burnout or mental illness without harming your economic prospects.
Thankfull I become economically independent from the technical Guernica known as the Software Industry, and can talk about real-life problems freely.

Those periods had a disproportionate impact on my life, and one of the intent of this blog it to get over them ; statisfying your voyeurism edge.


## What is DPDR?

[Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder) is little-known dissociative disorder with a prevalence of 1 to 2%, often undiagnosed and underresearched. It is essentially a defense mechanism against stress, that is itself pretty much shocking it if gets stuck. It goes by several names: DPDR, DDD, DDS, DPD...
