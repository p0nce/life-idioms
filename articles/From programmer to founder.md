# From programmer to founder

As a software developer (programmer) turned founder, there has been no shortage of surprising insight and realizations since I started on the business path in 2015.

- The realization that innovation can be a mistake,
- The realization that [you should probably pick an easy market](#No-one-will-tell-you-this-business-advice
),
- The realization that it ca be valid to deliberately ignore most of the user feedback,
- The realization that _tech_ is still very much important in a _tech business_,
- The realization that added value has a particular aesthetic.
