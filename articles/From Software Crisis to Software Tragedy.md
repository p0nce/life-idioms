# From Software Crisis to Software Tragedy

We propose that Software as practiced in our human societies is an inherently _tragic_ activity. As shown regularly by the catastrophic failures of software projects, there is a sobering difference between our aspirations and the reality.

One of the key feature of tragedy is the distance between human aspirations and outcome. And in few other domain the differences between our aspirations and the reality has been more sobering.


Indeed Software today has several observable macro-features.


## High recurring costs

_Debt_ seems to be a central theme to software development, but humans are more prone to taking on debt than being able to pay it down. What is being observed is high recurring costs, the most obvious of which is the need for growing teams of engineers for essentially problems that scale sublinearly.


## Abandonment, being late, under-delivering

There is a tendency for software projects to run late, over-budget, under-deliver, and even create litigation. This inefficiency has been dubbed _Software crisis_ by observers.
Such crisis is heavily documented by Capers Jones in The Economics of Software Quality.


## An acitivity that don't learn from the past

Few key lessons from the past seems to be retained in software. Software was already quite-well understood in the 1960s.
