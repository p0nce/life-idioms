# Attention, Time, Money

I'd like to introduce the unfortunate acronym **ATM** (Attention-Time-Money) as an aggregate measure of cost.
For simplicity, these resources can be considered the same thing. Some authors may use the term "pain".

Think of it as "price".


## Software Debt

Successful software artifacts generates positive ATM instead of consuming it (negative ATM).

If a software artifact necessitates positive ATM, it is a software **debt**.
If a software artifact necessitates negative ATM, it is a software **asset**. 

Assets and debt _are the same thing_, points on this flattened 1D axis of Attention, Time, and Money.

Another word for asset will be **successful** software. 



## On getting rich / On getting ATM

An advice on getting rich given by Robert T. Kiyosaki is to acquire assets and not acquire debt: a tautology.

A translated advice on getting successful software (positive ATM), is to acquire software assets and not acquire software debt.


## ATM over time

Obviously, a software artifact consumes or generates Attention, Time, and Money differently at different part of its lifecycle.

**The term "ATM" does indeed refers to its integral over the software artifact's lifetime.**

Going into details, it is the integral over infinite time, of:
- the immediate money production of this artifact `M(x, t)`
- the immediate attention production of this artifact `A(x, t)`
- the immediate time production of this artifact `T(x, t)`
