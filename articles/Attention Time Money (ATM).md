# Attention, Time, Money

I'd like to introduce the unfortunate acronym **ATM** (Attention-Time-Money) as an aggregate measure of economical value of software. For simplicity, these resources can be considered the same quantity and convertible. 

Is ATM "pain"? Is it "price"? It's better to think it as _the price of a stock_. 

Much like _stocks_, the value of ATM (their "price") aggregates all future revenue/cost associated with a particular piece of software, down to the smallest unit.


## Software Debt

Successful software artifacts generates positive ATM instead of consuming it (negative ATM).

If a software artifact necessitates positive ATM, it is a software **debt**.
If a software artifact necessitates negative ATM, it is a software **asset**. 

Assets and debt _are the same thing_, points on this flattened 1D axis of Attention, Time, and Money.

Another word for asset will be **successful** software. 



## On getting rich / On getting ATM

An advice on getting rich given by Robert T. Kiyosaki is to acquire assets and not acquire debt: a tautology that still deserved a book.

A translated advice on getting successful software (positive ATM), is to **acquire software assets and not acquire software debt.**


## ATM as goal


This define a criterion for ruling out methods.
Given alternative A and B, **the alternative that maximize ATM is to be preferred in a sytematic way.**


## ATM over time

Obviously, a software artifact consumes or generates Attention, Time, and Money differently at different part of its lifecycle.

**The term "ATM" does indeed refers to its integral over the software artifact's lifetime.**

Going into details, it is the integral over infinite time, of:
- the immediate money production of this artifact `M(x, t)`
- the immediate attention production of this artifact `A(x, t)`
- the immediate time production of this artifact `T(x, t)`

And I'm not sure what value we could derive from those last definitions.
