# Attention, Time, Money

I'd like to introduce the unfortunate acronym **ATM** (Attention-Time-Money) as an aggregate measure of economical value of software. For simplicity, these resources can be considered the same quantity and convertible. 

Is ATM "pain"? Is it "price"? It's better to think it as _the price of a stock_. 

Much like _stocks_, the value of ATM (their "price") aggregates all future revenue/cost associated with a particular piece of software, [down to the smallest unit](#Software-Artifacts-as-elementary-unit).


## Software Debt

Successful software artifacts generates positive ATM instead of consuming it (negative ATM).

If a software artifact has negative ATM, it is a software **debt**.
If a software artifact has positive ATM, it is a software **asset**. 

Assets and debt _are the same thing_, points on this flattened 1D axis of Attention, Time, and Money.

Another word for asset could be **successful** software, but I don't like it since it pollutes the mental images with images of what successful people do. I prefer the term of **positive ATM software**.



## On getting rich / On getting ATM

An advice on getting rich given by Robert T. Kiyosaki is to acquire assets and not acquire debt: a tautology that still deserved a book.

A translated advice on getting successful in software (positive ATM), is to **acquire software assets and not acquire software debt.**


## ATM as goal?

This define a criterion for ruling out methods.
Given alternative A and B, **the alternative that would maximize ATM would be preferred in a sytematic way.** However, it is not easily measurable at all, and we don't have here the equivalent of a Stock Market to the value of such a stock.

See: [Software Artifacts as elementary units](#Software-Artifacts-as-elementary-unit)

Moreover, and more critically, ATM is the amount of current and future value the software would bring to **everyone**, but this ATM is splitted, very often unevenly, amongst several entities. Whether a software artifact is a debt or an asset depends upon who is considered as owner.
