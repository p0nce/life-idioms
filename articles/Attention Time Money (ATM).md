# Attention, Time, Money


In this essay, we consider **ATM** (Attention-Time-Money) as an aggregate measure of "cost".
Arguably, the most important resource is **Attention**. For simplicity, we consider these resources to be the same thing.



## Attention 

Attention is the unit of work that goes into software develpement.

- Something that will need time in the future has an Attention Debt.

**However, the concept of generating Attention doesn't really exist.** No device or magic will give you more amount of attention. That's why we consider it a more fundamental resource than either Time or Money.

To avoid confusion about the already existing concept of attention, we'll speak of "ATM" to make clear those different cost are linearly related.



## Money

Money can buy other's Time.

- Something that will need money in the future has a Money Debt.
- Something that will produce money in the future is a Money Asset.


## Time

Time is a proxy for Attention, and converts to it reliably given sufficient motivation and energy levels. 

Attention = Time x Energy.

- Something that will need time in the future has a Time Debt.
  eg: a useless internal tool that has to be maintained
- Something that will save time in the future is a Time Asset.
  eg: a useful internal tool

It is considered a more precious resource than Money, because no amount of Money can buy your time back. However, money helps people avoiding to loose more.



## Energy 

Giving attention cannot be sustained very long in a typical day.
For that reason, managing energy levels is of incredible importance to the software practitionner. 

Expert advice is then to ignore about Time and focus on Energy instead.




## Asset vs Debt

An Asset is being considered as negative Debt (and vice versa). Those are the two sides of the same axis.
So there is only debt.

**Debt** is paid in this currency of **ATM**: Attention-Time-Money.
