# Software

Given the concept of [ATM](Attention-Time-Money-(ATM)), we propose the following ontology of software.



- **PFS** (Pure Form Software), an idealized form without constraints except those of Software themselves.
  It is an useful concept, to be likened to the "rational agent" from economic theories.

- **SAWKI** (Software As We Know It) is a realistic form of software, made by teams of humans, under financial constraints.




## On the tragicness of software

_Tragic_ is the only term that comes to mind when thinking about how software development is done in our human society.

Software as practiced by human is an inherently _tragic_ activity.
- There is a tendency for software projects to run late, over-budget, under-deliver. This inneficiency has been dubbed _Software crisis_ by observer, and was never solved.
- Few key lessons from the past are ever learned in software. Software was well-understood in 1960, but the actual practice has lagged behind indefinately.
- _Debt_ seems to be a central theme to software development, but humans are more prone to taking on debt than being able to pay it down.


As shown regularly by the catastrophic failures of software projects, there is a sobering difference between our aspirations and the reality.
