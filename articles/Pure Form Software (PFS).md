# Pure Form Software (PFS)

Is _Software As We Know It_ a good base to reason about _Software_?


## Software As We Know It

When talking about software, the analysis is more than often heavily biased towards _software as we know it_.

And most software out there share the following, earthly traits:
- A. has been made by human beings, 
- B. in a team,
- C. has been made with financial/time/attention constraints




My postulate is that this complicates acquiring knowledge about software, and prevents Diagonal Thinking applied to software.

Our hope is that there must exists laws of software that are independent of these factors. 

We call this "Pure Form software" (PFS) the software that is being made by perfect beings, without money concern. Is there still something interesting to tell about this fiction?



## Pure Form Software (PFS)

PFS is a non-existent form a software who would:
- enjoys unlimited monetary/time/attention resource, 
- would be made by very intelligent, powerful general AIs, that enjoy no communication penalty when working as a team.


In other words, PFS has unlimited [DFA]().


Because the postulate themselves are impossible, pure form software is neither practical nor desirable, and we'll use it as a limit case.


### Theorem 1: Pure form software would be built instantly

The stakeholder would hire as many AIs as needed with their unlimited resource, to make that software.


### Theorem 2: Pure form software has no accidental complexity

Because pure form software is built instantly, it can also be refactored instantly.


### Theorem 3: Pure form software stick to market needs perfectly.

Like a sort of High Frequency Trading, but for software needs, pure form software (in a world that would permit it) would perfectly stick to market needs.



Consequently, it would be built near instantly and also achieve its goal. What would be the output of such a process?





## Sofware is made by human being

If we are to analyze software correctly, we have to consider the cases where aliens would have written the same software, and where they wouldn't.

In an alien world, there are chances the sieve of Eratosthenes would be written with a similar algorithm.

That most software we know is written by humans is correlated, but







differentiate when being written by humans matters, and where aliens would have written the same software.



## software is usually made in a team.
