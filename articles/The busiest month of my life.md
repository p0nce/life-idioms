# The busiest month of my life

In a surprising sequence of events, the month of mid-July to mid-August 2019 was **a lot** more eventful than usual.

- I moved and then was suspected in the murder of my former landlord, who was strangulated (I'll write about it later).
- Had an brief affair with someone I later fell in love with.
- Had a scary one-hour relapse in [DPDR](#What-DPDR-feels-like) because of a book.
- Moved flat.
- People helped get back into the new flat when I locked myself out, and then stole my wallet.

All that happened while _I didn't really care_ since I was in the very important process of releasing a product.

Being adventurous is not exactly a goal to me ; I consider it more like a fault.
I'm thankful such a high-intensity month did not ever repeat.
