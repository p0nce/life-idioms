# Software As We Know It (SAWKI) vs idealized forms

Is _Software As We Know It_ a good base to reason about _Software_?


## Software As We Know It (SAWKI)

When talking about software, the analysis is squarely talking about _software as we know it_.

And most software out there share the following, earthly traits:
- Humanity Constraint (HC). Made by human beings, with a limited memory and knowledge.
- ARM Constraint (ATMC). Made with [ATM](Attention,#20Time,#20Money) constraints.

Let's call "Pure Form software" (PFS) the software that is being made by perfect beings, without money concern.



## Pure Form Software (PFS)

PFS is a non-existent form a software who would:
- enjoys unlimited [ATM](Attention,#20Time,#20Money), 
- would be made by very intelligent, powerful general AIs, that enjoy no communication penalty when working as a team.


In other words, PFS has unlimited [ATM](Attention,#20Time,#20Money).


Because the postulate themselves are impossible, pure form software is neither practical nor desirable, and we'll use it as a limit case.


### Theorem 1: PFS would be built instantly

The stakeholder would hire as many AIs as needed with their unlimited resource, to make that software.


### Theorem 2: PFS has no "accidental" complexity

Because pure form software is built instantly, it can also be refactored instantly.


### Theorem 3: PFS stick to market needs perfectly.

Like a sort of High Frequency Trading, but for software needs, pure form software (in a world that would permit it) would perfectly stick to market needs.



Consequently, it would be built near instantly and also achieve its goal.





## Sofware is made by human being

If we are to analyze software correctly, we have to consider the cases where aliens would have written the same software, and where they wouldn't.

In an alien world, there are chances the sieve of Eratosthenes would be written with a similar algorithm.

That most software we know is written by humans is correlated, but







differentiate when being written by humans matters, and where aliens would have written the same software.



## software is usually made in a team.
