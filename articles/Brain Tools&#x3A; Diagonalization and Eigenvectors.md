# Brain tools: Diagonalization and Eigenvectors

_If you need to read only one article from this blog, read this one._


I was mildly interested in singing, and tried to learn to sing all by myself.

I reached a plateau pretty quickly. Whatever the exercises devised, and the quantity of singing performed, there would be no improvement anymore.

In the choruses I was part of, people were saying being an autodidact doesn't get you very far with singing, and your real learning only start at your first personal singing lesson. I couldn't believed that.

But they were right. After 4 years, I gave in and finally started as a student with Marie, a very skilled teacher. What I learned next was indeed much more solid and durable than my own mental model and completely replaced it. It showned me that, at least for me, it was completely wrong to self-learn singing.

The content of these lessons was, as I found out, aimed at breaking this kind of skill ceiling.



## The content of those singing lessons

So what did we do differently?
- Actively stop to practice my own, self-made exercises.
- Actively try to warm-up and sing in different settings, public or not, in different places. 
- Being able to warm-up despite being ill.
- Mental framing to imagine a larger scene or crowd, or using a persona to sing.
- Always having two songs to learn at once, not just one.
- Exercises to _decouple_ muscles, for example rotating shoulders while humming low.
- Quickly vary the song the student has to sing, in order to avoid some kind of sterile overlearning.
- Not reifying the act of singing, stop thinking "I'm gonna hit this note", just hit the note instead.
- Mix of integrating top-down and detailed bottom-up work (for example, fixing bad vowel sounds).
- I felt like I was always pushed on the edge of my current abilities. A teaching concept explained to me much later by another teacher as the [ZPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development).

A common theme of the course was largely _decoupling_. Marie once said she was trying to augment "neural recombination". I would also go jogging, as I noticed earlier that it [helped learning](#Identify-body-chemicals).


## Decoupling what?


So I got decoupled glottal opening, decoupled air flow, decoupled vocal tract, decoupled this-or-that resonance, and now sang the same way whatever the place (but not the crowd). 

It was like those parameters were some kind of _proper_ dimensions of singing, and I just had to map the former, correlated parameters to those new truer, decorrelated ones.

Often, once decoupled, a particular control was forgotten again, like larynx positionning.

I could now change one parameter (eg: air flow) without having the others moving, thus being able to sing a high note for example.


## The link with eigenvectors


It turns out this is similar process to **diagonalization**.

In mathematics, diagonalization is a linear algebra process that allows to find the true _independent_ basis vectors of a linear space.

Those true, clean values are called **eigenvectors**.

The magnitudes of these eigenvectors are different. Some are more important than others, a fact used in [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), where the first row of the diagonal matrix is occupied by the most important vector (the most important factor of success, in a way).


## The takeaway

To me, Diagonalization is the most powerful tool in the toolbox.

I later found out that this type of diagonialization is useful to all other domains, when you want to reach expertise. Intuitively, it makes sense that the best performers can identify best what is important or not in their domain.

My belief is that to be an expert (or even beat the experts) you need to re-learn your domain after first exposure, and go find its true eigenvectors, and their relative importance.


## Critics

Now that I read the above article, there was other teaching tricks involved in the singing lessons: the good use of the Zone of Proximal Development, the student-teacher relationship, the sense of community/imitation with other singers... which seems to imply that it's not all about that diagonalization concept I'm such a fan of.
