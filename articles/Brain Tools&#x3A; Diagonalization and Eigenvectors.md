# Brain tools: Diagonalization and Eigenvectors

_If you need to read only one article from this blog, read this one._


I was mildly interested in singing, and tried to learn to sing all by myself.

I reached a plateau pretty quickly. Whatever the exercises devised, and the quantity of singing performed, there would be no improvement anymore.

In the choruses I was part of, people were saying being an autodidact doesn't get you very far with singing, and your real learning only start aft your first personal singing lesson. I couldn't believed that at first.

After 4 years, I gave in and finally started as a student with Marie, a very skilled teacher. What I learned next was indeed much more solid and durable than my own mental model and completely replaced it. It showned me that, at least for me, it was completely wrong to self-learn singing.



## The content of those singing lessons

So what did we do differently?
- Actively stop to practice my own, self-made exercises.
- Actively try to warm-up sing in different settings, public or not, in different places. 
- Being able to warm-up despite being ill.
- Mental framing to imagine a larger scene or crowd, or using a persona to sing.
- Always having two songs to learn at once.
- Exercises to _decouple_ muscles, for example rotating shoulders while humming low.
- Quickly vary the song the student has to sing, in order to avoid some kind of static neural pathways.
- Not reifying the act of singing, stop thinking "I'm gonna hit this note", just hit the note instead.
- Mix of integrating topdown and detailed downtop work (for example, fixing bad vowel sounds).
- I was always pushed on the edge of my current abilities.

A common theme of the course was largely _decoupling_. Marie once said she was trying to augment "neural recombination". I would go jogging, as it [helped learning](#Identify-body-chemicals).


## Decoupling what?


So I got decoupled glottal opening, decoupled air flow, decoupled vowels and glottal opening, decoupled this-or-that resonance, and now sang the same way whatever the place (but not the crowd). 

It was like those parameters were some kind of _proper_ dimensions of singing, and I just had to map the former, morass parameters to those new truer ones.

Often, once decoupled, a particular control was forgotten again, like larynx positionning.

I could now change one parameter (eg: air flow) without having the others moving, thus being able to sing a high note for example.


## The link with eigenvectors


It turns out this is similar process to **diagonalization**.

In mathematics, diagonalization is a linear algebra process that allows to find the true _independent_ basis vectors of a linear space.

Those true, clean values are called **eigenvectors**.

The magnitudes of these eigenvectors are different. Some are more important than others, a fact used in [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), where the first row of the diagonal matrix is occupied by the most important vector (the most important factor of success, in a way).


## The takeaway

I later found out that this type of diagonialization is useful to all other domains, when you want to reach expertise. Intuitively, it makes sense that the best performers can identify best what is important or not in their domain.

My belief is that to be an expert (or even beat the experts) you need to re-learn your domain after first exposure, and go find its true eigenvectors.
