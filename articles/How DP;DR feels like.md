# How DP;DR feels like

Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR) is a dissociative disorder. 
It is essentially a defense mechanism against sustained cortisol levels (stress).

DPDR is about having no personnality.

DPDR is surprisingly very painful, like living in hell. Nothing can explain the feeling. Thankfully it is also revertible and pretty much works in a mechanical way.


## Stress

Your body is locked in "survival mode".
You don't feel stressed anymore while suffering DPDR, however you can recognize that the cortisol is hidden by the dissociation, and the stress is still here underneath.


## Emotions

The sufferer is unable to have emotions like joy, love, sadness - and feels no attachment either.
Seeing a loved-one will provoke you no more emotion that if you had encountered an automaton.
Under DPDR, seeing old friends is like meeting strangers for the first time.

It also applies to nature: pretty mountains are now a sort of postal cards, a decor in the film of your life.

## Art

Music, films, and museums can give a lot more impression than usual.


## Memory

Life through this traumatic period is intense, however memories are not treated the same while the DPDR is active.

While the DPDR lasts, it very much seems like _life outside dissociation_ will never come back, and was long ago. Something to be forgotten since that now, you're seemingly permanently altered (and not in a good way !). **DPDR always feels like the new normal**, however twisted it is.

Strangely enough, life under such dissociation doesn't feel less "real" than normalcy. It actually **feels more real** since the "humanity layer" that was interpreting raw information is gone, and you are left with what feels like a more raw, over-analytic, reptilian brain. 

This is why I say personality is like being in a bubble: it filters information and creates meaning when there is sometimes little.

When things go back to the normalcy you thought was impossible though, you will have trouble remembering what really happened and in what order while dissociated. It will seem very remote that you could have had no personnality for such a period of time.








## Artificially provoking DP;DR

First of all, I strongly advise you **to never do it** it since


You can simulate part of that effect by creating an artificial effect of _jamais vu_ though artificial means.

The book _La Naus√©e_ from Sartre is also evidentlyw written by someone who deeply know the disorder. Reading it made me relapse once because of the particular though pattern it follows. Even that short relapse was about the worst feeling I might have.

In any case, if you fall trapped into DP;DR it is very important to keep in mind that it is a normal mechanism and only lowering the stress levels will reform your self.




## How does it work?


Essentially, the forces that maintain _continuity of meaning_ for things, concepts, words, and of course your personnality, stop their course. 


Like the fast movement of the eye giving the impression of a detailed, high resolution visual world ; the fast _meaning creation_ of the brain is giving the impression of whole concept and personnality.

In a way, having a personnality is a comforting bubble.

The person experiencing DPDR see its personnality structure dissolved, only to be reformed when the stress get back down. For me this "reformation" takes six month.
