</a><h1 id="i-m-a-former-sufferer-of-dpdr"> I'm a former sufferer of DPDR</h1>
<p>Few people know this about me, but I've been technically "mad" with the trouble known as Depersonalization / Derealization Disorder (DPDR) and got out of it.
</p>
<h2 id="my-story-with-dpdr"> My story with DPDR</h2>
<p>I've had 3 episodes of DPDR, starting at age 19:
</p>
<ul>
<li>2007: a severe 2 month episode, drug-induced comorbid with HPPD, BDD, tinnitus, and a small depression.<br/>  I knew nothing about the trouble, and thought it was a unique situation. I told no one and only heared about "DPDR" 3 years later.
</li>
<li>2011 to 2012: a one year burnout cycle that ended up in DPDR, comorbid with emotional depletion, and suicidal thoughts for the last month.
</li>
<li>2019: a one hour relapse, short but scary enough. I just read the wrong book by Sartre!
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm very lucky to be cured thanks to <a href="Processing-Traumas">trauma processing</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="what-is-dpdr"> What is DPDR?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder">Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR)</a> is little-known dissociative disorder with a prevalence of 1 to 2%, often undiagnosed and underresearched. It is essentially a defense mechanism against stress, that is itself pretty fucked up. It goes by several names: DPDR, DDD, DDS, DPD.
</p>
<p><a href="#What-DPDR-feels-like">How does DPDR feels?</a>
</p>
</div><a name="What-DPDR-feels-like"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#What-DPDR-feels-like">Link
</a><h1 id="what-dpdr-feels-like"> What DPDR feels like</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder">DPDR</a> is living without a personnality.
</p>
<p>What might seems at first like a curious metaphysical experience, is instead a <strong>surprisingly painful condition</strong> that takes everything you have.
</p>
<p>For me, light DPDR will just feature a lack of emotions. But strong DPDR most accurate definition would be "a living hell". 
</p>
<h2 id="stress"> Stress</h2>
<p>While the disease itself is caused by stress, you <strong>don't</strong> feel stressed anymore while suffering DPDR.<br/>The cortisol is hidden by the dissociation. The stress is still here, underneath.
</p>
<p>Basically your body is locked in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response">fight-or-flight</a> response.
</p>
<p>In this situation, you are in need of coping mechanisms, such as watching someone else's story. Because the real source of the stress might be remote and you don't have the serenity to investigate.
</p>
<h2 id="third-person"> Third person</h2>
<p>You are the Observer.<br/>You are not living but watching someone lives that happens to be yourself.<br/>You do not meet people but flesh actors that believes they are people. The fact they believe they are people is of course beyond ridiculous, because all humans are cardboard automatons. <br/>You do not walk in nature, but in a decor in the film of your life.
</p>
<p>The Observer is a feeling that can be invoked independently of DPDR, once cured.<br/>It is quite hard to invoke in normal times. But in DPDR you are locked into this 3rd person mode: the most objective you have ever been.
</p>
<h2 id="emotions"> Emotions</h2>
<p>The sufferer is unable to have emotions like joy, love, sadness - and feels no attachment either.<br/>Seeing a loved-one will provoke you no more emotion that if you had encountered a lifeless robot.
</p>
<p>Under DPDR, seeing old friends is like meeting strangers. Because - as we'll see later on - the concept of your friendship have disintegrated. Like most other concepts.
</p>
<h2 id="brain-fog"> "Brain fog"</h2>
<p>Severe DPDR comes with a particular mental restlessness that can hamper the ability to sleep, think, and relax. The sufferer is typically afraid of becoming schizophrenic, for no reason at all.
</p>
<h2 id="memory"> Memory</h2>
<p>While the DPDR lasts, it very much seems like <em>life outside dissociation</em> will never come back, and was long ago. Something to be forgotten since that now, you're seemingly permanently altered (and not in a good way !). <strong>DPDR feels like the new normal</strong>, something final even, however twisted that is.
</p>
<p>The possibility that things may be back to normal look very remote.
</p>
<p>Strangely enough, life under such dissociation doesn't feel less "real" than normalcy. It actually <strong>feels more real</strong> since the humanity layer that was interpreting raw information is gone, and you are left working with an older, raw, analytic, reptilian-era brain. 
</p>
<p>Life under DPDR is stripped of its human elements, and as such it feels obviously simpler and truer.
</p>
<p>This is why I say personality is like being in a bubble: it filters information and creates meaning when there is sometimes little.
</p>
<p>When things go back to the normalcy you thought was impossible though, you will have trouble remembering what really happened and in what order while dissociated. It will seem very remote that you could have had no personnality for such a long period of time.
</p>
<h2 id="meaning-dissolvation"> Meaning dissolvation</h2>
<p>It's hard to explain properly this one after so many years.
</p>
<p>Essentially, the forces that maintain <em>continuity of meaning</em> for things, concepts, words, and of course your personnality (which is mental object like any other...), stop their course.
</p>
<p>You would look at an pear, see it is of a particular pear shape, pear color, and has a word for it: "pear". <br/>But none of these things form a cohesive whole around an actual "pear" concept you might previously have.
</p>
<p>In a way, <strong>the "pear" concept only has a sustained existence because we continue to nourish it</strong>.
</p>
<p>Like the fast movement of the eye giving the impression of a detailed, high resolution visual world ; the fast <em>meaning creation</em> of the brain is giving the impression of whole well-separated concepts that help understanding the world.
</p>
<p>The person experiencing DPDR see its personnality structure dissolved, because <em>every other thought concept was also dissolved</em>.
</p>
<p>In a way, having a personnality is a <strong>comforting bubble</strong> that sustain that meaning creation. It has a good User Experience that simplifies life for us. And indeed, life outside the bubble is pretty much unlivable.
</p>
<h2 id="art"> Art</h2>
<p>On the plus side.<br/>Music, films, and museums can give a lot more impression than usual. I've had strong reactions to, all things considered, pretty average music in these times.
</p>
<h2 id="when-dpdr-disappears"> When DPDR disappears</h2>
<p>DPDR disappears in a pretty much mechanical way: less stress leading to less dissociation.
</p>
<p>Emotions, feelings, and information filtering come back. It is an immense relief.<br/>What happens next is that a new personnality appears in about six month, not too far from the original.
</p>
<p>This is also <strong>a very interesting time</strong> when you can seemingly choose the features of your newfound personnality bubble.

</a><h1 id="software-artifacts-as-elementary-unit"> Software Artifacts as elementary unit</h1>
<p>I'd like to reason upon any kind of software artifacts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>an octet
</li>
<li>a for loop
</li>
<li>a function
</li>
<li>a class object
</li>
<li>a whole product
</li>
<li>a product portfolio
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this blog these will be called "software artifacts".
</p>
<p>A <em>Software Artifact</em> has:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Existence.</strong> Has a physical extent in lines of codes, documentation, or data presence <code class="prettyprint">Extent(x)</code>.<br/>  Arguably if it isn't there, then it doesn't exist.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Price.</strong> For each artifact <code class="prettyprint">x</code>, we note <code class="prettyprint">ATM(x)</code> the amount of Attention/Time/Money gained by <code class="prettyprint">x</code> existing.<br/>  This is the cost to write the artifact, the cost to maintain it, selling it, etc. aggregated over its total lifetime.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>  More often than not, this ATM isn't known.
</p>
<h2 id="equality"> Equality</h2>
<p>Two software artifacts <code class="prettyprint">A</code> and <code class="prettyprint">B</code> are <strong>equal</strong> iff <code class="prettyprint">Extent(A) == Extent(B)</code>.<br/>They have equal ATM.
</p>
<h2 id="composition"> Composition</h2>
<p>A software artifact is <strong>composed of</strong> other software artifacts, down to a unit level of minimum physical existence.<br/>For example, the for loop is made of the <code class="prettyprint">for</code> keyword, itself composed of <code class="prettyprint">f</code>, <code class="prettyprint">o</code>, <code class="prettyprint">r</code> characters.
</p>
<p>While it is difficult to think of an ATM just for a <code class="prettyprint">f</code> letter, we postulate that it exists.
</p>
<p>Composition is noted <code class="prettyprint">A + B</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="independence"> Independence</h2>
<p>Two artifacts <code class="prettyprint">A</code> and <code class="prettyprint">B</code> are <strong>independent</strong> if for every artifact <code class="prettyprint">a</code> that compose <code class="prettyprint">A</code>, <code class="prettyprint">a</code> cannot be found composing <code class="prettyprint">B</code>.
</p>
<p>Example: 
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>Company Comcom has two completely independent software products Toto and Titi,
that don't share a single file.
</code></pre><p>Postulate: if <code class="prettyprint">A</code> and <code class="prettyprint">B</code> are independent, then <code class="prettyprint">ATM(A + B) = ATM(A) + ATM(B)</code>.
</p>
<p>Example:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>The Toto product earns $1000 a month and the Titi product $2000 a month, 
without any attention or time commitment, without sharing a single file.
Since they are independent, ATM(Titi + Toto) = ATM(Titi) + ATM(Toto). 
Their earnings add up independently.
Note that we still don't know the actual value of ATM(Titi) or ATM(Toto).
</code></pre><h2 id="decomposition-rule"> Decomposition rule</h2>
<p>If software artifacts <code class="prettyprint">A</code> and <code class="prettyprint">B</code> are not independent, there exist 3 independent artifacts <code class="prettyprint">a</code>, <code class="prettyprint">b</code>, <code class="prettyprint">C</code> such that:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">A == C + a</code>
</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">B == C + b</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case: <code class="prettyprint">ATM(A + B) = 2.ATM(C) + ATM(a) + ATM(b)</code>
</p>
<p>Example:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>The Toto and Titi products now share some library code Baba.
Toto earns $10000 a month and the Titi product only $100 a month, 
without any attention or time commitment.
ATM(Titi + Toto) = 2.ATM(Baba) + ATM(Toto-specific code) + ATM(Titi-specific code)
</code></pre><p>Intuitively, we find that the most reused software artifacts have the most impact in the earnings of the company.<br/>In this case, <code class="prettyprint">ATM(Toto-specific-code)</code> is probably large, but we don't know it's exact value.<br/>We <em>also</em> don't know the split between <code class="prettyprint">Baba</code> and <code class="prettyprint">Toto-specific code</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="we-still-don-t-know-the-atm-value"> We still don't know the ATM value</h2>
<p>Up to now, our proxy for knowing <code class="prettyprint">ATM(x)</code> is the very measurable <em>immediate sales generated by x</em>.
</p>
<p>But this is only an approximation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the full cost is the integral over time of Attention, Time and Money. Not the immediate Money generation.<br/>  ATM is to software, what stocks are to companies.
</li>
<li>Sales do not tell the story of Time and Attention consumed by <code class="prettyprint">x</code>. A fact often lamented in "technical debt" rants.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>While ATM is the primary measure of success in an artifact, we have only a passing understanding of its real value. Instead what is used is a short-term, partial, proxy measurement for ATM: sales.</strong>
</p>
</div><a name="Attention-Time-Money-(ATM)"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#Attention-Time-Money-(ATM)">Link
</a><h1 id="attention-time-money"> Attention, Time, Money</h1>
<p>I'd like to introduce the unfortunate acronym <strong>ATM</strong> (Attention-Time-Money) as an aggregate measure of economical value of software. For simplicity, these resources can be considered the same quantity and convertible. 
</p>
<p>Is ATM "pain"? Is it "price"? It's better to think it as <em>the price of a stock</em>. 
</p>
<p>Much like <em>stocks</em>, the value of ATM (their "price") aggregates all future revenue/cost associated with a particular piece of software, down to the smallest unit.
</p>
<h2 id="software-debt"> Software Debt</h2>
<p>Successful software artifacts generates positive ATM instead of consuming it (negative ATM).
</p>
<p>If a software artifact necessitates positive ATM, it is a software <strong>debt</strong>.<br/>If a software artifact necessitates negative ATM, it is a software <strong>asset</strong>. 
</p>
<p>Assets and debt <em>are the same thing</em>, points on this flattened 1D axis of Attention, Time, and Money.
</p>
<p>Another word for asset will be <strong>successful</strong> software. 
</p>
<h2 id="on-getting-rich-on-getting-atm"> On getting rich / On getting ATM</h2>
<p>An advice on getting rich given by Robert T. Kiyosaki is to acquire assets and not acquire debt: a tautology that still deserved a book.
</p>
<p>A translated advice on getting successful software (positive ATM), is to <strong>acquire software assets and not acquire software debt.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="atm-as-goal"> ATM as goal</h2>
<p>This define a criterion for ruling out methods.<br/>Given alternative A and B, <strong>the alternative that maximize ATM is to be preferred in a sytematic way.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="atm-over-time"> ATM over time</h2>
<p>Obviously, a software artifact consumes or generates Attention, Time, and Money differently at different part of its lifecycle.
</p>
<p><strong>The term "ATM" does indeed refers to its integral over the software artifact's lifetime.</strong>
</p>
<p>Going into details, it is the integral over infinite time, of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the immediate money production of this artifact <code class="prettyprint">M(x, t)</code>
</li>
<li>the immediate attention production of this artifact <code class="prettyprint">A(x, t)</code>
</li>
<li>the immediate time production of this artifact <code class="prettyprint">T(x, t)</code>
</li>
</ul>

</a><h1 id="a-lot-happened-in-july-2019"> A lot happened in July 2019</h1>
<p>In a surprising sequence of events, the month of mid-July to mid-August 2019 was <strong>a lot</strong> more eventful than usual.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I moved and then was suspected in the murder of my former landlord.
</li>
<li>Had an brief affair with someone I later fell in love with.
</li>
<li>Had a scary one-hour relapse in <a href="#What-DPDR-feels-like">DPDR</a> because of a book.
</li>
<li>I released a new plug-in Panagement 2.0.
</li>
<li>Moved flat.
</li>
<li>People helped get back into the new flat when I locked myself out, and then stole my wallet.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Being adventurous is not exactly a goal to me ; I consider it more like a defect.<br/>So I was very thankful that such a high-intensity month did not ever repeat.
