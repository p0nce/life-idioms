</a><h1>ATM Case Studies #1: Should you fix this bug?</h1>
<p><em>For that problem we will avoid all discussions of ownership, as they are often tautological.</em></p>
<p>Some things you can't know before building them, for example the outcome of an algorithm, or the cost of a bug fix.</p>
<h2>The problem to illustrate this</h2>
<p>Edouard resize images with lanczos3. He's trying the magic kernel, but the result has a new bug. What to do? Persevere or abandon the effort?</p>
<h2>Translated in ATM terms</h2>
<p>In entity <code>E</code> codebase, there is an image resizer <code>R</code>.</p>
<p><code>E</code> wants to try another image resizing algorithm <code>A</code>, and take the best one. <code>R' = R + A</code> is created.
Unfortunately, to use the new algorithm there is a bug fix <code>B</code> to be found first, a memory corruption.</p>
<p>The new algorithm suitability (<code>R'</code> better than <code>R</code>) can only be assessed once <code>R'</code> has been built.
The new algorithm can only be used once <code>R''</code> has been built.</p>
<p>We suppose independent decomposition of R' into R and A, and of R'' into R' and B.</p>
<p>**What should do E:</p>
<ol>
<li>keep <code>R</code></li>
<li>develop <code>R' = R + A</code>?</li>
<li>develop <code>R'' = R + A + B</code>?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Intuitively, it's not worth building <code>R'</code> is the new algorithm can't be better.</li>
<li>Intuitively, it's not fixing it, if the new algorithm doesn't prove better in tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously the ATM outcome of doing nothing is the &quot;BATNA&quot; choice, <code>ATM(R)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>For the R vs R' decision</strong></p>
<p>The algorithm should be built if:</p>
<pre><code>ATM(R') - ATM(R) &gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>Under our postulate of independence this is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>ATM(A) &gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>A being the specific modification of R that implements the new algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>For the R' vs R'' decision</strong></p>
<p>The algorithm should be debugged if the fix is a positive ATM artifact:</p>
<pre><code>ATM(B) &gt; 0
</code></pre>
<h2>So we are stuck there</h2>
<p>We need a way to decomposate ATM alongside conditionals.
Much like we assume stock price to vary in the future depending on yet unknown events, such as the earth exploding.</p>
<p>We'll define <strong>conditionals</strong> with small letters.</p>
<pre><code>ATM(X | e) = ATM of artifact X, given than e will occur in the future.
ATM(X | ~e) = ATM of artifact X, given than e will not occur in the future.
</code></pre>
<p><code>ATM(X)</code> being a perfect, unknown price, it is equal to either exactly <code>ATM(X | e)</code> or exactly <code>ATM(X | ~e)</code>.</p>
<h2>Let's get back to our problem</h2>
<p>Let <code>c</code> be the conditional &quot;new algorithm better than older&quot;.
Let <code>D</code> be the ATM gain of &quot;having a better algorithm&quot;.</p>
<p>We estimate:</p>
<pre><code>ATM_approx(A | c) = price of writing(A) + price-of-maintaining(A) + D
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>ATM_approx(A | ~c) = price of writing(A)
</code></pre>
<p>Thus we can estimate <code>ATM(A)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>ATM_approx(A) = ATM_approx(A | c) * prob(c) + ATM_approx(A | ~c) * (1 - prob(c))
</code></pre>
<p>So this is exactly a <strong>Bayesian</strong> rule.</p>
<p>Our solution is now:</p>
<pre><code>ATM_approx(A) = price of writing(A) + ( price-of-maintaining(A) + D) * prob(c)
</code></pre>
<p>We can evaluate this to know approximately if this is worth it to attempt to write <code>A</code>.</p>
<h2>Should <code>E</code> fix the bug?</h2>
<p>This is equivalent, <code>E</code> should attempt to fix the bug if <code>ATM_approx(B)</code> is estimated to be &gt; 0.</p>
<p>Let <code>b</code> be the conditional &quot;E manages to fix the bug&quot;.
Let <code>G</code> be the ATM gain of &quot;having the bug fixed&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>ATM(B | b) = price of writing(B) + ( price-of-maintaining(B) + G) * prob(b)
ATM(B | ~b) = price of failing to write(B)
</code></pre>
<p>The ATM of the fix is, in our analysis:</p>
<pre><code>ATM(B) = price of failing to write(B) * (1 - prob(b)) + price of writing(B) + ( price-of-maintaining(B) + G)
</code></pre>
<p>This respect the tautological nature of our theory, since if the bug fixed can be found 100% of the time, then ATM(B) = ATM(B | b).</p>

</a><h1>ATM Case Studies #1: Dependency vs Write-your-own</h1>
<p>That is a very typical situation!</p>
<p>Entity <code>E</code> <em>owns</em> software artifact <code>A</code>. <code>E</code> wants a new feature which is in library <code>B</code>, completely developped by others. However, there is also the possibility to write its own feature instead of depending on <code>B</code>.</p>
<h2>Translated in ATM terms</h2>
<p>Let <code>A'</code> be the software artifact <code>A</code> after the change.</p>
<p><code>E</code> wants to maximize its <a href="#Who-owns-software?">own ATM share</a> of <code>A'</code> (maximize: <code>ATM-E(A')</code>).</p>
<p>Depending on the path followed, `A' could be equal to:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A'</code> = <code>A</code> + <code>B</code> (dependency case)</li>
<li><code>A'</code> = <code>A</code> + <code>C</code> (write-your-own case)</li>
</ul>
<p>Posed as an inequality, <code>E</code> should write its own if:</p>
<pre><code>ATM-E(A + B) &lt; ATM-E(A + C)
</code></pre>
<p>We know that <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are <a href="#Software-Artifacts-as-elementary-unit">independent</a>.</p>
<pre><code>ATM-E(A) + ATM-E(B) &lt; ATM-E(A + C)
</code></pre>
<p>We know that <code>E</code> owns A and C completely. That gives <code>ATM-E(A) = ATM(A)</code> and <code>ATM-E(C) = ATM(C)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ATM(A) + ATM-E(B) &lt; ATM(A + C)
</code></pre>
<p>We know that <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> are not independent (it is expected that <code>C</code> will reuse parts of <code>A</code>), so we factor out their common part <code>D</code></p>
<pre><code>A = D + (A without C)
C = D + (C without A)
</code></pre>
<p>Replacing:</p>
<pre><code>ATM(D) + ATM(A without C) + ATM-E(B) &lt; 2 x ATM(D) + ATM(A without C) + ATM(C without A)
</code></pre>
<p>Simplifying:</p>
<pre><code>ATM-E(B) &lt; ATM(D) + ATM(C without A)
</code></pre>
<p>Simplifying again:</p>
<pre><code>ATM-E(B) &lt; ATM(C)
</code></pre>
<p>So we've gone in a full circle tautology: <code>E</code> should write its own if the expected value of <code>C</code> over its lifetime exceeds the value of <code>B</code>, for <code>E</code>, over its lifetime.</p>
<p><em>We haven't said anything there yet.</em></p>
<h2>Attempt at decomposing costs</h2>
<p>We postulate for this problem that ATM(x) will be split between:</p>
<ul>
<li>a creation cost <code>C(x)</code>, that also includes learnings and injuries, not just initial work</li>
<li>increased business value because of the feature <code>P(x)</code></li>
<li>a maintenance cost <code>M(x)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Of those:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>P(x)</code> would be typically &gt;= 0</li>
<li><code>M(x)</code> would be typically &lt;= 0</li>
<li>in the case of infinitely long-lived software, <code>C(x)</code> is much smaller in magnitude than <code>M(x)</code> and <code>P(x)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our equation becomes:</p>
<pre><code>C-E(B) + M-E(B) + P-E(B) &lt; C(C) + M(C) + P(C)
</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>B</code> is completely <em>owned</em> by others, C-E(B) is zero:</p>
<pre><code>M-E(B) + P-E(B) &lt; C(C) + M(C) + P(C)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we postulate that the feature leads to equal sales, whether it comes from artifact B or C. <strong>This is, debatable postulate.</strong></p>
<pre><code>P(C) = P-E(B)
M-E(B) &lt; C(C) + M(C)
</code></pre>
<p>We stumble upon our second tautology: the cumulated maintenance ATM of C, plus its creation ATM, plus the learnings and injuries ATM, must be greater than the ATM cost of maintaining <code>B</code> (partially).</p>
</div><a name="Software-Artifacts-as-elementary-unit"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#Software-Artifacts-as-elementary-unit">Link
</a><h1>Software Artifacts as elementary unit</h1>
<p>I'd like to reason upon any kind of software artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>an octet</li>
<li>a for loop</li>
<li>a function</li>
<li>a class object</li>
<li>a whole product</li>
<li>a product portfolio</li>
</ul>
<p>In this blog these will be called &quot;software artifacts&quot;.</p>
<p>A <em>Software Artifact</em> has:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Existence.</strong> Has a physical extent in lines of codes, documentation, or data presence <code>Extent(x)</code>.
Arguably if it isn't there, then it doesn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Price.</strong> For each artifact <code>x</code>, we note <code>ATM(x)</code> the amount of Attention/Time/Money gained by <code>x</code> existing.
This is the cost to write the artifact, the cost to maintain it, selling it, etc. aggregated over its total lifetime (like <em>stocks</em>).</p>
<p>More often than not, this ATM isn't known.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Equality</h2>
<p>Two software artifacts <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are <strong>equal</strong> iff <code>Extent(A) == Extent(B)</code>.
They have equal ATM.</p>
<h2>Composition</h2>
<p>A software artifact is <strong>composed of</strong> other software artifacts, down to a unit level of minimum physical existence.
For example, the for loop is made of the <code>for</code> keyword, itself composed of <code>f</code>, <code>o</code>, <code>r</code> characters.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to think of an ATM just for a <code>f</code> letter, we postulate that it exists.</p>
<p>Composition is noted <code>A + B</code>. It means the artifact A <em>and</em> the artifact B, in juxtaposition, possibly overlapped.</p>
<h2>Independence</h2>
<p>Two artifacts <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are <strong>independent</strong> if for every artifact <code>a</code> that compose <code>A</code>, <code>a</code> cannot be found composing <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Company Comcom has two completely independent software products Toto and Titi,
that don't share a single file.
</code></pre>
<p>Postulate: if <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are independent, then <code>ATM(A + B) = ATM(A) + ATM(B)</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>The Toto product earns $1000 a month and the Titi product $2000 a month, 
without any attention or time commitment, without sharing a single file.
Since they are independent, ATM(Titi + Toto) = ATM(Titi) + ATM(Toto). 
Their earnings add up independently.
Note that we still don't know the actual value of ATM(Titi) or ATM(Toto).
</code></pre>
<h2>Decomposition rule</h2>
<p>If software artifacts <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are not independent, there exist 3 independent artifacts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>C</code> such that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A == C + a</code></li>
<li><code>B == C + b</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In this case: <code>ATM(A + B) = 2.ATM(C) + ATM(a) + ATM(b)</code></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>The Toto and Titi products now share some library code Baba.
Toto earns $10000 a month and the Titi product only $100 a month, 
without any attention or time commitment.
ATM(Titi + Toto) = 2.ATM(Baba) + ATM(Toto-specific code) + ATM(Titi-specific code)
</code></pre>
<p>Intuitively, we find that the most reused software artifacts have the most impact in the earnings of Comcom the company.
In this case, <code>ATM(Toto-specific-code)</code> is probably large, but we don't know it's exact value.
We <em>also</em> don't know the split between <code>Baba</code> and <code>Toto-specific code</code>.</p>
<h2>We still don't know the ATM value</h2>
<p>In typical practice, a proxy for knowing <code>ATM(x)</code> is the very measurable <em>immediate sales generated by x</em>.</p>
<p><strong>This is wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Because this is only an approximation:</p>
<ul>
<li>the full cost is the integral over time of Attention, Time and Money. Not the immediate Money generation.
ATM is to software, what stocks are to companies.</li>
<li>Sales do not tell the story of Time and Attention consumed by <code>x</code>. A fact often lamented in &quot;technical debt&quot; rants.</li>
<li>ATM is value for the world in general. Every actor actually gets <a href="#Who-owns-software?">a different share of that number</a>, possibly negative.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>While ATM is the primary measure of success in an artifact, we have only a passing understanding of its real value. Instead what is used is often a short-term, partial, proxy measurement for ATM: sales for the shareholder.</strong></p>

</a><h1>Brain tools: Diagonalization and Eigenvectors</h1>
<p><em>If you need to read only one article from this blog, read this one.</em></p>
<p>I was mildly interested in singing, and tried to learn to sing all by myself.</p>
<p>I reached a plateau pretty quickly. Whatever the exercises devised, and the quantity of singing performed, there would be no improvement anymore.</p>
<p>In the choruses I was part of, people were saying being an autodidact doesn't get you very far with singing, and your real learning only start at your first personal singing lesson. I couldn't believed that.</p>
<p>But they were right. After 4 years, I gave in and finally started as a student with Marie, a very skilled teacher. What I learned next was indeed much more solid and durable than my own mental model and completely replaced it. It showned me that, at least for me, it was completely wrong to self-learn singing.</p>
<p>The content of these lessons was, as I found out, aimed at breaking this kind of skill ceiling.</p>
<h2>The content of those singing lessons</h2>
<p>So what did we do differently?</p>
<ul>
<li>Actively stop to practice my own, self-made exercises.</li>
<li>Actively try to warm-up and sing in different settings, public or not, in different places.</li>
<li>Being able to warm-up despite being ill.</li>
<li>Mental framing to imagine a larger scene or crowd, or using a persona to sing.</li>
<li>Always having two songs to learn at once, not just one.</li>
<li>Exercises to <em>decouple</em> muscles, for example rotating shoulders while humming low.</li>
<li>Quickly vary the song the student has to sing, in order to avoid some kind of sterile overlearning.</li>
<li>Not reifying the act of singing, stop thinking &quot;I'm gonna hit this note&quot;, just hit the note instead.</li>
<li>Mix of integrating top-down and detailed bottom-up work (for example, fixing bad vowel sounds).</li>
<li>I felt like I was always pushed on the edge of my current abilities. A teaching concept explained to me much later by another teacher as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">ZPD</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common theme of the course was largely <em>decoupling</em>. Marie once said she was trying to augment &quot;neural recombination&quot;. I would also go jogging, as I noticed earlier that it <a href="#Identify-body-chemicals">helped learning</a>.</p>
<h2>Decoupling what?</h2>
<p>So I got decoupled glottal opening, decoupled air flow, decoupled vocal tract, decoupled this-or-that resonance, and now sang the same way whatever the place (but not the crowd).</p>
<p>It was like those parameters were some kind of <em>proper</em> dimensions of singing, and I just had to map the former, correlated parameters to those new truer, decorrelated ones.</p>
<p>Often, once decoupled, a particular control was forgotten again, like larynx positionning.</p>
<p>I could now change one parameter (eg: air flow) without having the others moving, thus being able to sing a high note for example.</p>
<h2>The link with eigenvectors</h2>
<p>It turns out this is similar process to <strong>diagonalization</strong>.</p>
<p>In mathematics, diagonalization is a linear algebra process that allows to find the true <em>independent</em> basis vectors of a linear space.</p>
<p>Those true, clean values are called <strong>eigenvectors</strong>.</p>
<p>The magnitudes of these eigenvectors are different. Some are more important than others, a fact used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">PCA</a>, where the first row of the diagonal matrix is occupied by the most important vector (the most important factor of success, in a way).</p>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>To me, Diagonalization is the most powerful tool in the toolbox.</p>
<p>I later found out that this type of diagonialization is useful to all other domains, when you want to reach expertise. Intuitively, it makes sense that the best performers can identify best what is important or not in their domain.</p>
<p>My belief is that to be an expert (or even beat the experts) you need to re-learn your domain after first exposure, and go find its true eigenvectors, and their relative importance.</p>
<h2>Critics</h2>
<p>Now that I read the above article, there was other teaching tricks involved in the singing lessons: the good use of the Zone of Proximal Development, the student-teacher relationship, the sense of community/imitation with other singers... which seems to imply that it's not all about that diagonalization concept I'm such a fan of.</p>

</a><h1>DIY Processing Traumas</h1>
<p><strong>DICLAIMER: Do not read that article and do not Do It Yourself. This article is only my opinion.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Go find a licensed psychologist, that will find a respectful and manageable path towards processing traumas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The mentionned techniques can be pretty confusing, harsh and generates permanent personnality changes. It is even the entire goal.
But reactivation of traumatic memories can be very harmful and in some cases cause anxiety attacks and extreme levels of stress.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have to do that, do it from a position of comfort, when you are already feeling great.</strong></p>
<h2>Why process traumas?</h2>
<p>After two episodes of <a href="What-DPDR-feels-like">DPDR</a>, I forcefully became interested in lowering those stress levels for good.
Despire its strangeness, DPDR is mechanical: it goes away if the stress goes down.</p>
<p>It turned out the main contributor to chronic high-stress levels was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_memories">unprocessed traumatic memories</a>. A thesis also defended on <a href="http://depersonalizationrecovery.com/">that other website</a>.</p>
<p>I'm convinced <strong>everyone has a backlog of unprocessed traumas</strong> and could benefit from thinking about it, when the conditions feels right.</p>
<p>Activating the traumatic memories for examination create a stress of its own, and a chronic one, so it's better to process traumas from a comfortable position.
Or, to process the ones that have already been reactivated in a chronic manner.</p>
<p>In other words: do things one by one and leave ample times before such works.</p>
<p>And it's also better to only treat the most recently activated source of stress.</p>
<p><strong>Go in reverse temporality and do not start searching for traumas, start from the stress of daily life to find them.</strong></p>
<h2>Start small</h2>
<p>Processing traumas gets easier with practice. <strong>Start with easy ones and go slow.</strong></p>
<p><em>Example 1: Adam was driving, and see a dog about to cross the road. He slows down. But the dog doesn't move at all, he just stands here just next to the road, as if about to cross. It turns out it was probably dead and another car hit it in the nose. Adam is disgusted and this particular memory comes back after the trip.</em></p>
<p><em>Example 2: Bob watched a film named <em>The Act of Killing</em>. It is the most disturbing film he has ever watched. He regrets watching it and made a nightmare with a traumatic color and a film protagonist that says with a horrible voice &quot;Are you going to kill me?&quot;.</em></p>
<p>Sounds small potatoes, yeah? Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>In almost every case, you will be astounded by the emotional charge associated with even small events like this.
By association you <em>will</em> stumble upon the big stuff, sooner or later, but do not rush this.</p>
<p><strong>Be kind with yourself</strong> and try to find inconsequential things, perhaps even non-traumatic things, to think about.</p>
<h2>Mental model of traumatic memories</h2>
<p>This article proposes a method (akin to Neuro-Linguistic Programming) to self-treat lingering traumas by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_memories#Reconsolidation">reconsolidating traumatic memories</a>. The Wikipedia article is better than this article so maybe jump your reading there.</p>
<p>Do you really want to read a method from an armchair psychologist?</p>
<h2>Full recipe</h2>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Start Point.</strong></h3>
<p>Using <a href="#Brain-Tools:-Focused-attention-vs-Open-Monitoring">Open Monitoring</a> think about the distressing recent stress, or a permanent stress you've felt.</p>
<p>You will get a start point to your associative journey.</p>
<p><em>Exemple: Adam thinks about his sentiment of dread seeing the dead dog on the road.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: associative search.</strong></h3>
<p>Perform one (or more) of the most obvious <a href="#Brain-Tools:-Associative-Jumps">Associative Jumps</a>.</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself and find the true most obvious jumps. You can end your associative search on several types of mental-object:</p>
<ul>
<li>a memory</li>
<li>a belief</li>
<li>a &quot;rite of passage&quot; (door to be entered, cavern... &quot;do you want to know?)</li>
</ul>
<p>So there are 3 possible scenarios here, only one of which is adressed in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Case 2.1: The trauma is complex.</strong><br />
You end up on a &quot;core belief&quot; or a &quot;value&quot;, unrelated to a single memory but a myriad of non-traumatic memories.</p>
<p><em>Exemple: &quot;I was raised as if I had no value.&quot;</em></p>
<p>This is best treated with actual psychotherapy such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">CBT</a>, not by treating traumas.<br />
Exit this tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Case 2.2: The trauma is singular.</strong><br />
You end up on a <strong>single memory from where most of the stress is originating.</strong></p>
<p><em>Exemple: &quot;They day where Adam's dog died.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Wait</strong> before you think about that particular memory. Continue avoiding it until safety is in place.<br />
Go to step 3.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Case 2.3: The trauma is inter-generational (advanced).</strong><br />
After a mental &quot;rite of passage&quot; (that you can refuse), you end up on unspecific abstract traumas with no emotional charge, no associated memories.</p>
<p><em>Exemple: &quot;The fuzzy feeling of being beaten by someone larger.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately I do not have enough experience with that to advise you. The problem is that one doesn't have any traumatic memory to work with.<br />
Exit this tutorial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Reconsolidation.</strong></h3>
<p>Your goal is to discharge the emotional content of the singular memory and &quot;re-learn&quot; it.</p>
<p>Use the following two powerful safety procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use the time-reverse method:</strong> explore your memory from a few hours after to the beginning in a reverse fashion. The film is in reverse in the cinema.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use double disassociation:</strong> method: you are watching someone in a cinema who watch the film of your memory on a screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should not be overwhelmed by emotions. Reliving the trauma as is (exposure) is NOT the goal.</p>
<p>What you can do then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examinate subsequent beliefs:</strong> You may have &quot;over-learned&quot; something because of the trauma.</li>
<li><strong>Change modalities:</strong> Change the shape, colors, scent of things in your memory to make it clear you are rewriting it. Why not make the memory ridiculous?</li>
<li><strong>Change point of view:</strong> If an agression, view the scene as the aggressor, a spectator, etc.. what is a rational explanation for what happened?</li>
<li><strong>Just watch the reversed film:</strong> Reintegrate it into your autobiographic memory. Because of time reversal, sometimes it's not even needed to go through the violent parts.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you are done, the memory should be reintegrated/modified as a normal memory, without emotional charge.
Release of tears and a sentiment of peace is a good sign.
You can do this while staying calm, it need not be a panicky feeling.</p>
<p><em>One very disturbing thing at first is that <strong>there is no actual need to be faithful about what really happened</strong> in your new tampered memory since only the results matter.</em>
<em>The truth matters less than your well-being. If the truth mattered so much, our memory wouldn't be rewriteable. But, traumatized people are often obsessed with realistic exact history and it can feel like &quot;cheating&quot;.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: The case of larger traumas (optional)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>For a large trauma</strong> your life have been clearly split in two disjointed timelines, before and after the event.
And you don't feel the same person before and after.</p>
<p>It is possible that you meet a &quot;trauma-holder&quot;, a personality fragment at the age that you were at the memory point.
If you want to solve the trauma, you will accept the trauma holder as he/she is, and somehow merge it with your current self.
If you do this, you will have a single merged life timeline again.</p>
<p>In computer terms, a trauma would be a bit like a new <code>git branch</code>, and solving the traumas is akin to a <code>git merge</code>.
But the analogy stops here, because the forked branch has been left undevelopped and in disarray.</p>
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>Lowered stress levels seems permanent.
Solving most singular traumas shift personnality for a few weeks.
Some advanced mental manipulations like that can provoke larger swings in personnality (eg: maniac phase / depressive phase) that can oscillate for a few monthes.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you don't want to be on your own, go consult a licensed psychologist.</p>

</a><h1>On being a former sufferer of DPDR</h1>
<p>A few people IRL know this about me, but in the past I've been technically &quot;mad&quot; with the trouble known as Depersonalization / Derealization Disorder (DPDR).</p>
<p>While many people experience symptoms of a depersonalization/derealization disorder during their life; I have a simple theory about why few people talk about it: it is difficult to explain and too shameful/asocial to tell.</p>
<h2>My story with DPDR</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>2007:</strong> a severe 2 month episode, psylocibyn-induced comorbid with HPPD, BDD, tinnitus.
I was 19 :).</li>
<li><strong>2011 to 2012:</strong> a one year burnout cycle that ended up in mild DPDR, comorbid with emotional depletion, and suicidal thoughts for the last month. It felt like forever.</li>
<li><strong>2019:</strong> a one hour relapse, short but scary enough.
I would read La Nausée by Sartre and it turns out the book can effectively trigger the disease temporarily for me, thanks to its play on words.</li>
</ul>
<p>I consider myself cured from 2012 to 2014 thanks to DIY <a href="#DIY-Processing-Traumas">trauma processing</a>, a great method for a whole lot of troubles.</p>
<h2>Why talk about it at all?</h2>
<p>It feels sane, and culturally possible in 2021, to be in a position to admit to those weaknesses.</p>
<p>In the software industry you cannot really speak about things like burnout or mental illness without harming your economic prospects.
Thankfull I become economically independent from the technical Guernica known as the Software Industry, and can talk about real-life problems freely.</p>
<p>Those troubled periods had a disproportionate impact on my life. One of the intent of this blog it to get over them; while statisfying your voyeurism edge.</p>
<h2>What is DPDR?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder">Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR)</a> is little-known dissociative disorder with a prevalence of 1 to 2%, often undiagnosed and underresearched. It is essentially a defense mechanism against stress, that gets somehow stuck. It goes by several names: DPDR, DDD, DDS, DPD...</p>
<p>DPDR is strongly associated with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.158.7.1027">childhood interpersonal trauma</a>.</p>

</a><h1>Brain tools: Associative Jump</h1>
<p>In order to process trauma, explain aesthetics, and understand various other brain phenomenons, I think it is helpful to reify a basic brain operation that we could call <strong>Associative Jumps</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Mental objects are linked in a web.</p>
<h2>Example 1</h2>
<p><em>Albert was evaluating a particular audio effect (tape machine emulation), when he is assaulted by overwhelming sad feelings that prevent him to continue his evaluation.</em></p>
<p><em>Question: What could be a rational explanation for this?</em></p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;I'm hearing a tape machine.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>JUMP</strong> &quot;This makes me think about childhood, an era where this sound was everywhere.&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>JUMP</strong> &quot;I've thought about my past and feel an intense nostalgia.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p><em>Heavily intoxicated, Albert founds out that hearing pitched noise create a heavy release of neurotransmitters. Frequency 487 Hz seem to generate oxytocin, while 2.2 KHz generates something that looks like acetylcholine. Another one is all about serotonine. Albert is impressed, goes on and concludes that chakras exist and that you can equalize them with sound! But this doesn't seem to work when Albert's attention is taken.</em></p>
<p><em>Question: What could be a rational explanation for this?</em></p>
<p><strong>Actually</strong> this can be explained partly by placebo, but also by an increase in the associative engine in the brain due to intoxication.</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;I'm hearing this frequency.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>JUMP</strong> &quot;This organ should be vibrating, if there is such a frequency to be heard&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>JUMP</strong> &quot;That organ that is near and is endocrinal is stimulated. Its output increase.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>This all happens quickly enough to feel instant.</p>
<p><em>Question: How to validate this explanation?</em></p>
<p>Stepping into the chain and seeing if the associative chain still holds.
In this case, you could do without the noise, just thinking about the body part.</p>
<h2>How to find the jump?</h2>
<p>In sober state, finding the associative jump can take more effort, especially since multiple of them are valid destinations. <a href="#Brain-Tools:-Focused-attention-vs-Open-Monitoring">Open Monitoring</a> may help here, by revealing the most obvious contributors.</p>
<p>It seems to be that most useful jumps are also the easiest to find. <strong>There is something that I don't understand though, it is that Associative Jumps do not seem to be as repeatable as expected.</strong></p>
</div><a name="Brain-Tools&#x3A;-Focused-attention-vs-Open-Monitoring"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#Brain-Tools&#x3A;-Focused-attention-vs-Open-Monitoring">Link
</a><h1>Brain Tools: Focused Attention vs Open Monitoring</h1>
<p>There seems to be 3 big types of meditation, two of which have been categorized as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2010.01.007">&quot;Focused Attention&quot; and &quot;Open Monitoring&quot;</a> (Travis &amp; Shear, 2010).</p>
<p>You can get a feel for those results:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You could meditate with focused attention and reach <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Enter-Alpha-State-of-Mind">Alpha State</a>, which takes some training.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You could meditate with open monitoring and without particular training, get troubling thoughts out of the way <em>(which is super useful for stress)</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, with the example of hearing, I claim that there is likewise <strong>two ways of listening,</strong> completely parallel to those two meditation types.</p>
<h2>Case 1: Focused Attention listening</h2>
<p>In focused attention, you concentrate on an individual feature, possibly loosing the forest for the trees. Everything else that might tend to attract attention is actively ignored by redirecting attention constantly back on the same focus point.</p>
<p><em>Example: &quot;Which sound has the best low-end?&quot;?</em></p>
<h2>Case 2: Open Monitoring listening</h2>
<p>In Open Monitoring listening, <strong>you would try to think about nothing</strong> and examinate the first thing that comes to your mind.</p>
<p><em>Example: &quot;Which sound would you rather hear in your car?&quot;</em></p>
<h2>A more general claim</h2>
<p>I claim that there is always those two ways of considering a perception (possibly: any mental object?).</p>
<p>Reifying Open Monitoring is super useful indeed, since <strong>by being open to ideas that come up, you can more easily perform <a href="#Brain-Tools:-Associative-Jumps">Associative Jumps</a>, or find a start point to your associative search.</strong></p>
<p>Open Monitoring is called <a href="http://deconcentration-of-attention.com/">&quot;Deconcentration of Attention&quot;</a> in the Russian litterature.</p>
</div><a name="Identify-body-chemicals"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#Identify-body-chemicals">Link
</a><h1>Identify body chemicals</h1>
<p><strong>DICLAIMER: I'm not a physiologist, and do not work in medicine. Do not start new addictions. I'm just dabbling. The reality is probably more complex.</strong></p>
<p>In research of diagonalization, I feel that it can be helpful to identify body compounds by their imprint, in order to try to &quot;invert&quot; their effects on judgement.</p>
<p>Often the idea is to eat chemical precursors to increase the quantity effect of the compound.</p>
<h2>Sugar</h2>
<p>A good way to develop a sense for effects of sugar is biking. Because this sport puts you closer to being an energy tank.</p>
<h2>Serotonin</h2>
<p>Using THC 1 hour after eating <em>chick peas</em> will produce a high that has a serotonin color. You might even feel a buzz from chick peas alone after one hour.</p>
<p>Fasting also increase serotonine.</p>
<h2>Dopamine</h2>
<p>Using THC 1 hour after eating <em>red beans</em> will produce a high that has a serotonin color.
Beware: this is more anxiety-inducing than just THC.</p>
<p>This seems to increase placebo effects, or to be the root cause of it.</p>
<h2>Anandamide</h2>
<p>The so-called runner's high is partly anandamide.</p>
<p>2 hours before running, drink a combination of: paracetamol, powder chocolate and grapeseed oil. It has an awful taste.</p>
<h2>BNDF</h2>
<p>The other component of the runner's high (BNDF) seems to require fasting and slow running a long-time.</p>
<h2>Testosterone</h2>
<p>Sensed the most the day after sport, especially if high intensity was involved.</p>
<h2>Inflammation (not a compound)</h2>
<p>General quantity of inflammation can be lowered with Chinese cabbage (for example eating half of it).</p>
<p>Instead, it can be increased with carbs, such as bread/pasta, which feels much worse.</p>
<h2>Do you know any others?</h2>
<p>I'd like to hear ways to distinguish norepinefrine, GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine...
It is also possible I'm mistaking one chemicals for another.</p>
</div><a name="Attention-Time-Money-(ATM)"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#Attention-Time-Money-(ATM)">Link
</a><h1>Attention, Time, Money</h1>
<p>I'd like to introduce the unfortunate acronym <strong>ATM</strong> (Attention-Time-Money) as an aggregate measure of economical value of software. For simplicity, these resources can be considered the same quantity and convertible.</p>
<p>Is ATM &quot;pain&quot;? Is it &quot;price&quot;? It's better to think it as <em>the price of a stock</em>.</p>
<p>Much like <em>stocks</em>, the value of ATM (their &quot;price&quot;) aggregates all future revenue/cost associated with a particular piece of software, <a href="#Software-Artifacts-as-elementary-unit">down to the smallest unit</a>.</p>
<h2>Software Debt</h2>
<p>Successful software artifacts generates positive ATM instead of consuming it (negative ATM).</p>
<p>If a software artifact has negative ATM, it is a software <strong>debt</strong>.
If a software artifact has positive ATM, it is a software <strong>asset</strong>.</p>
<p>Assets and debt <em>are the same thing</em>, points on this flattened 1D axis of Attention, Time, and Money.</p>
<p>Another word for asset could be <strong>successful</strong> software, but I don't like it since it pollutes the mental images with images of what successful people do. I prefer the term of <strong>positive ATM software</strong>.</p>
<h2>On getting rich / On getting ATM</h2>
<p>An advice on getting rich given by Robert T. Kiyosaki is to acquire assets and not acquire debt: a tautology that still deserved a book.</p>
<p>A translated advice on getting successful in software (positive ATM), is to <strong>acquire software assets and not acquire software debt.</strong></p>
<h2>ATM as goal?</h2>
<p>This define a criterion for ruling out methods.
Given alternative A and B, <strong>the alternative that would maximize ATM would be preferred in a sytematic way.</strong> However, it is not easily measurable at all, and we don't have here the equivalent of a Stock Market to the value of such a stock.</p>
<p>See: <a href="#Software-Artifacts-as-elementary-unit">Software Artifacts as elementary units</a></p>
<p>Moreover, and more critically, ATM is the amount of current and future value the software would bring to <strong>everyone</strong>, but this ATM is splitted, very often unevenly, amongst several entities. Whether a software artifact is a debt or an asset depends upon who is considered as owner.</p>
<p>See: <a href="#Who-owns-software?">Who owns software?</a></p>
</div><a name="Thoughts-should-pay-for-themselves"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#Thoughts-should-pay-for-themselves">Link
</a><h1>Thoughts should pay for themselves</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>In an ideal world, all software in existence would have positive <a href="#Attention-Time-Money-(ATM)">ATM</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contrarily Software with negative ATM is <em>debt</em> and wouldn't exist in that ideal world. Consequently, software debt doesn't <em>deserve to exist</em> (in the same way that there are no stocks with negative values).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it were found that organized thoughts (and books) follow a similar ATM economics as software, then they also wouldn't deserve to exist.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The very act of forming and maintaining <em>mental debt</em> (instead of <em>mental assets</em>) would be a net loss to the individual ; in the same way that negative ATM software is a net loss to society in general.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In other words: not all books deserve to be written, and not all thoughts deserve to be formed. And there will be interests to pay on them too: bad books being read, or bad thoughts being maintained.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the same ways that ATM is distributed across everyone (even negatively), maintaining mental debt can be efficient for society <em>as a whole</em>, just not for the open that holds that debt.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Strangely my conclusion is at odds with the premise.</p>
</div><a name="Who-owns-software&#x3F;"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#Who-owns-software&#x3F;">Link
</a><h1>Who owns the software?</h1>
<p>Once we have the concept of <a href="#Attention-Time-Money-(ATM)">ATM</a> we can define the concept of software ownership more precisely.</p>
<h2>Observation 1</h2>
<p>The customer pays for software typically with Money, and derive some positive or negative value out of its existence.</p>
<h2>Observation 2</h2>
<p>Smart companies have their employees maintain &quot;ownership&quot; over codebases. The idea is that worker <code>W</code> knows more than anyone else about <a href="#Software-Artifacts-as-elementary-unit">software artifact</a> <code>A</code>. Repairing A will be less costly when <code>W</code> is doing it.</p>
<p>In economical terms, by virtue of having <code>W</code> know more about <code>A</code>, <code>ATM(A)</code> gets a higher value.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the company gets to be the &quot;shareholder&quot; and obviously pay for this software being created.</p>
<h2>Who owns the software?</h2>
<p><strong>Who &quot;owns&quot; the software artifact <code>A</code>?</strong> Is it <code>W</code> or the company employing <code>W</code> to work on <code>A</code>? Is it <code>C</code> the customer that bought it?</p>
<p>Our proposal is that <code>ATM(A)</code> is typically split between:</p>
<ul>
<li>the &quot;code owner&quot;/worker <code>W</code>,</li>
<li>the sharedholder <code>S</code>,</li>
<li>the customer <code>C</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new definition of ATM is that <strong>it is the sum of individual ATM contribution of every entity:</strong></p>
<pre><code>ATM(A) = sum[for every entity E](ATM(E, A))
</code></pre>
<p>Hence:</p>
<pre><code>ATM(A) = ATM-W(A) + ATM-S(A) + ATM-C(A)
</code></pre>
<p>In our split with 3 entities it is the sum of ATM of individual actors. Here is how to account for it:</p>
<p><strong><code>ATM-S</code></strong> (ATM for Shareholder) would contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregated benefits from A existing: sales, future velocity, industry contacts, distribution opportunities...</li>
<li>Labor costs: workers current and future salaries (Money here being traded for Time and Attention).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><code>ATM-W</code></strong> (ATM for Worker) would contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain of <a href="#Thoughts-should-pay-for-themselves">positive ATM knowledge</a>.</li>
<li>The economical loss that stems from negative ATM knowledge.</li>
<li>The pain or pleasure derived from working with artifact A.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aggregated benefits from working on A: eg. work opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><code>ATM-C</code></strong> (ATM for Customer) would contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregated benefits from A existing.</li>
<li>Present and future costs from operating the software (price, brain damage, recurrent costs...)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these factors include <em>current and future events</em>.</p>
<p>Whether W, S, or C should be considered the &quot;owner&quot; of artifact A depends on the particular split.</p>
<p><strong>Note that this is only one of the possible value split, since S, W and C can be one and the same.</strong></p>
<h2>Example: Contractor</h2>
<p><em>Ben is a contractor hired by TotoMetrics to make a small bug fix on their JSON parsing library. Ben charges $500 for that fix. He is done in 5 minutes and go on with his day. he forgets everything about it. He never works for TotoMetrics again.</em></p>
<p>In ATM terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>let <code>L</code> be the JSON parsing library with the bug</li>
<li>let <code>Lf</code> be the JSON parsing library after the fix</li>
<li>let <code>S</code> be the shareholder TotoMetrics</li>
<li>let <code>W</code> be Ben</li>
</ul>
<p>The company S hopes that:</p>
<pre><code>ATM-S(Lf) &gt; ATM-S(L) + $500
</code></pre>
<p>That is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>ATM(Lf) - ATM-W(Lf) &gt; ATM(L) - ATM-W(L) + $500
</code></pre>
<p>Now, for all intent and purpose Ben has no real exposure to <code>L</code>. <code>ATM-W(x)</code> is 0. That simplifies the equation to:</p>
<pre><code>ATM(Lf) &gt; ATM(L) + $500
</code></pre>
<p><code>S</code> in this case is the real &quot;owner&quot; of <code>L</code> since its ATM fraction <code>ATM-S</code> is equal to <code>ATM</code>. <code>S</code> will benefit completely from <code>L</code> losses and gains, and <code>W</code> won't be affected.</p>
<h2>Example: Idea Man</h2>
<p><em>Steve has an idea and tells Walter his idea of a new piece of software A. Walter like the idea and propose to build it for only $1000. When Steve fails to sell the early result, Walter steals the code, sabotage Steve online store, and sells it for its own benefit with no additional development. The customer of the software derive just recoup their investment, as they get $10 of value for their $10 of membership.</em></p>
<p>In ATM terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>let <code>A</code> be the product being built</li>
<li>let <code>S</code> be the shareholder Steve</li>
<li>let <code>W</code> be the worker Walter</li>
<li>let <code>C</code> be the customers (but we know that <code>ATM-C(A)</code> is 0)</li>
</ul>
<p>The hope of Steve is to get a positive ATM for himself:</p>
<pre><code>ATM-S(A) &gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>However if, as Steve will fail to sell the result forever it is pretty clear that ATM-S is known at: -$1000. No upside is expected for Steve forever, and salary was paid.</p>
<pre><code>ATM-S(A) = -$1000
</code></pre>
<p>For all intent and purpose Steve no exposure to <code>A</code> other than that loss.
Walter doesn't know if <code>A</code> will be an asset (positive ATM), but he knows he gets a $1000 head start on its own share of ATM.</p>
<pre><code>ATM-W(A) = ATM(A) + $1000
</code></pre>
<p>As Walter knows that its own rate on the market is $500/day, he hopes to have a good estimate of <code>ATM(A)</code> before 2 days, so he knows whether to abandon the project or not.</p>
<p>Obviously, a measure of &quot;ownership&quot; would need to account for the possibility of negative ATM. I'm not sure if a zero ATM means no ownership either, of if the whole concept of &quot;ownership&quot; is moot.</p>

</a><h1>What DPDR feels like</h1>
<p><em>DICLAIMER: I FORMALLY DECLINE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY HARM THAT COULD HAPPEN FOLLOWING THE READ OF THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE. Close this page now. This article isn't meant for anyone to read. You don't want to know. I'm only trying to <a href="#On-being-a-former-sufferer-of-DPDR">remember</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a dangerous article to read. And it was annoying to write. I'm really just doing it to try to connect the dots. Reading about DPDR triggers a strange meditative state for me. I'm genuinely scared to write that shit article. Only read this is you are not an anxious person. There is an interesting article <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/enlightenments-evil-twin/383726/">here</a> that is perfectly adequate to explain the most interesting points.</em></p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder">DPDR</a> is living without a personnality, and without &quot;storytelling&quot;. What might seems at first like a curious metaphysical experience, is also a <strong>surprisingly painful condition</strong>.</p>
<p>It comes in various intensity levels. Light DPDR features only a few symptoms, but strong DPDR is a living hell.</p>
<h2>Third person</h2>
<p>You are the Observer.
You are not living but watching someone live, that happens to be you.</p>
<p>You do not meet people but lifeless actors that believes they are people. The fact they believe they are people is of course ridiculous, because all humans are more like cardboard automatons.</p>
<p>The way they communicate with you makes it very clear they don't know they are carboard automatons, and they also believe in a fuckton of grand ideas that don't actually exist.</p>
<p>You do not walk in nature, but in a decor in the film of your life.</p>
<p>The Observer is a feeling that can be invoked independently of DPDR, once cured.
It is quite hard to invoke in normal times. But in DPDR you are locked into this 3rd person mode: the most objective you have ever been. :)
Consequently, you are more likely to perform &quot;out of character&quot; actions that will surprise and delight your peers.</p>
<h2>Stress</h2>
<p>While the disease itself is <em>caused</em> by stress, one <strong>do not</strong> feel stressed anymore while suffering DPDR.
The cortisol is hidden by the dissociation. The stress feeling is still here, but underneath.</p>
<p>Basically your body is locked in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response">fight-or-flight</a> response.</p>
<p>In this situation, you are in need of coping mechanisms, such as watching someone else's story. Because the real source of the stress might be remote and other symptoms may complicate root cause analysis.</p>
<h2>Emotions</h2>
<p>The sufferer is unable to have emotions like joy, love, sadness - and feels no attachment either.
Seeing a loved-one provokes no more emotion that if you had encountered a lifeless robot.</p>
<p>Under DPDR, seeing old friends is like meeting strangers. Because - as we'll see later on - the concept of your friendship have disintegrated. <em>Like most other concepts.</em></p>
<p>I guess because in a situation of acute danger, it isn't exactly critical to feel in love or sad.</p>
<h2>&quot;Brain fog&quot;</h2>
<p>Severe DPDR comes with a particular mental restlessness that can hamper the ability to sleep, think, and relax. Thoughts just won't stop. I think this is the worse symptom of heavy DPDR.</p>
<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>While the DPDR lasts, it very much seems like <em>life outside dissociation</em> will never come back, and was long ago. Something to be forgotten since that now, you're seemingly permanently altered (and not in a good way !). <strong>DPDR feels like the new normal</strong>, something final even, however twisted that is. Perhaps it was always this way?</p>
<p>The possibility that things may be back to normal looks very remote.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, life under such dissociation doesn't feel less &quot;real&quot; than normalcy. It actually feels <em>more</em> real since the &quot;humanity layer&quot; that was interpreting raw information is gone, and you are left working with an older, raw, analytic, bare-metal brain.</p>
<p>Life under DPDR is stripped of its human elements, and as such it feels obviously simpler and truer.</p>
<p>This is why I say personality is like being in a bubble: it filters information and creates meaning when there is sometimes little.</p>
<p>When things <em>do</em> go back to the normalcy you thought was impossible, you will have trouble remembering what really happened and in what order. It will seem very remote that you could have had no personnality for such a long period of time. Your time dissociated and non-dissociated feel like disjointed segments of life.</p>
<h2>Meaning generation has stopped</h2>
<p>It's hard to explain properly this one after so many years. I have difficulty remembering symptoms from 2007.</p>
<p>Essentially, the forces that maintain <em>continuity of meaning</em> for things, concepts, words, and of course your personnality (which is a mental object like any other...), stop their course.</p>
<p>You would look at an pear, see it is of a particular pear shape, pear color, and has a word for it: &quot;pear&quot;.
But none of these things form a cohesive whole around an actual &quot;pear&quot; concept you might previously have.</p>
<p>In normal times, <strong>concepts have a sustained existence because we continuously nourish them</strong>.</p>
<p>Like the fast movement of the eye giving the impression of a detailed, high resolution visual world ; the fast <em>meaning creation</em> of the brain is giving the impression of whole well-separated concepts that help understanding the world.</p>
<p>The person experiencing DPDR see its personnality structure dissolved, because <em>every other thought concept was also dissolved</em>. They were broke down to their constitutive components, without the story-teller that makes them united.</p>
<p>In a way, personnality is a comforting <strong>bubble</strong> that sustain that meaning creation. It insulates from tons of raw, meaningless events that do not sustain the personal narrative. The Ego has a good User Experience that simplifies life for us. As far as I'm concerned, it is definately a Good Thing.</p>
<h2>Art</h2>
<p>Music, films, and museums can give a lot more impression than usual. I would typically feel way more connection to music in this state.
This is definately a positive, as you get to find profoundness in pretty average things. :)</p>
<h2>When DPDR disappears</h2>
<p>DPDR disappears in a pretty much mechanical way: less stress leading to less dissociation.</p>
<p>Emotions, feelings, and information filtering come back. It is of course an immense relief, since you get to experience happiness again.
What happens next is that a new personnality appears in about six month, not too far from the original.</p>
<p>This is also <strong>a very important and interesting time</strong> when you can seemingly choose the features of your newfound personnality bubble.</p>

</a><h1>From programmer to founder</h1>
<p>As a software developer (programmer) turned founder, there has been no shortage of surprising insight and realizations since I started on the business path in 2015.</p>
<ul>
<li>The realization that innovation can be a mistake,</li>
<li>The realization that <a href="#No-one-will-tell-you-this-business-advice">you should probably pick an easy market</a>,</li>
<li>The realization that it can be valid to deliberately ignore most of the user feedback,</li>
<li>The realization that <em>tech</em> is still very much important in a <em>tech business</em>,</li>
<li>The realization that added value has a particular aesthetic.</li>
</ul>
</div><a name="The-busiest-month-of-my-life"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#The-busiest-month-of-my-life">Link
</a><h1>The busiest month of my life</h1>
<p>In a surprising sequence of events, the month of mid-July to mid-August 2019 was <strong>a lot</strong> more eventful than usual.</p>
<ul>
<li>I moved and then was suspected in the murder of my former landlord, who was strangulated (I'll write about it later).</li>
<li>Had an brief affair with someone I later fell in love with.</li>
<li>Had a scary one-hour relapse in <a href="#What-DPDR-feels-like">DPDR</a> because of a book.</li>
<li>Moved flat.</li>
<li>People helped get back into the new flat when I locked myself out, and then stole my wallet.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that happened while <em>I didn't really care</em> since I was in the very important process of releasing a product.</p>
<p>Being adventurous is not exactly a goal to me ; I consider it more like a fault.
I'm thankful such a high-intensity month did not ever repeat.</p>
</div><a name="No-one-will-tell-you-this-business-advice"></a><div class="idiom"><a class="permalink" href="#No-one-will-tell-you-this-business-advice">Link
</a><h1>No one will tell you this business advice</h1>
<p>Making a software business does teach <a href="#From-programmer-to-founder">a few non-obvious thing</a>.</p>
<p>The best business advice for first-time founders is, in my opinion, the following:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;PICK AN EASY MARKET&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The corrolary of which is:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;DO NOT PICK A DIFFICULT MARKET&quot;</strong></p>
<p>and also:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;DO NOT PICK A NON-EXISTING MARKET&quot;</strong></p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<h2>The problem with heroïcs ideals</h2>
<p>Having to do heroic efforts is indicative of a market that doesn't make lots of money for lots of people. Say, video games if you are the average independent game developer.</p>
<p>I believe picking a difficult market can be a consequence of <em>bourgeois thinking.</em></p>
<p>By picking a difficult market (aka... prestigious) you happens is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>stay high-status,</li>
<li>avoid really meddling with lower-class people,</li>
<li>avoid competition,</li>
<li>avoid work qualified as &quot;boring&quot;(we all know we mean &quot;low-status&quot; with that)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which are really non-goals for a business.</p>
<h2>The problem with skewing higher-class</h2>
<p>As a reader of that blog, you may probably skew on richer and higher-educated. This is also the characteristics of <strong>early adopters</strong> (cf. history of inventions).</p>
<p>In general, most founders  and the first users they will encouter will be a higher-class than the general population. <strong>This is bad.</strong></p>
<p>Consequently the stereotypical start-up company will look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>hiring high-class people,</li>
<li>to make products that mostly appeal to high-class people, and reflect high-class values,</li>
<li>and make no money in the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is inevitably far from realizing the growth potential, because <strong>you may inadvertently remove the majority of the target market</strong> with bourgeois thinking.</p>
<p>When I was a lowly snob intern at a very well known audio company, its founder told me very seriously that we were here to make software for everyone, not just snobs like me. Bourgeois thinking acts like a tax on society. <strong>This was one of the most on-point advice I ever got.</strong></p>
<h2>Actionnable advice</h2>
<p>Go the easiest market you can find, that verifiably make a lot of easy money for a non-trivial group of people. Make a product to get your foot in the door, and go bully the weakest competitor in the room.</p>
<p>That is the business advice you won't hear from anyone, because everyone is shooting status-enhancing quotes from Steve Jobs.</p>
